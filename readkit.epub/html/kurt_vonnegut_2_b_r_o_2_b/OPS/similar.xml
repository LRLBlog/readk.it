Year 2889</em></a>
<p>In the Year 2889 was first published in the Forum, February,
1889. It was published in France the next year. Although published
under the name of Jules Verne, it is now believed to be chiefly if
not entirely the work of Jules Verne's son, Michel Verne. In any
event, many of the topics in the article echo Jules Verne's
ideas.</p>

Good and Evil</em></a>
<p>Beyond Good and Evil (German: Jenseits von Gut und Böse),
subtitled "Prelude to a Philosophy of the Future" (Vorspiel einer
Philosophie der Zukunft), is a book by the German philosopher
Friedrich Nietzsche, first published in 1886.<br />
It takes up and expands on the ideas of his previous work, Thus
Spoke Zarathustra, but approached from a more critical, polemical
direction.<br />
In Beyond Good and Evil, Nietzsche attacks past philosophers for
their alleged lack of critical sense and their blind acceptance of
Christian premises in their consideration of morality. The work
moves into the realm "beyond good and evil" in the sense of leaving
behind the traditional morality which Nietzsche subjects to a
destructive critique in favour of what he regards as an affirmative
approach that fearlessly confronts the perspectival nature of
knowledge and the perilous condition of the modern individual.</p>

<p>This is Metropolis, the novel that the film's screenwriter --
Thea von Harbou, who was director Fritz Lang's wife, and a
collaborator in the creation of the film -- this is the novel that
Harbou wrote from her own notes. It contains bits of the story that
got lost on the cutting-room floor; in a very real way it is the
only way to understand the film.</p>

<p>Anthem is a dystopian fiction novella by Ayn Rand, first
published in 1938. It takes place at some unspecified future date
when mankind has entered another dark age as a result of the evils
of irrationality and collectivism and the weaknesses of socialistic
thinking and economics. Technological advancement is now carefully
planned (when it is allowed to occur at all) and the concept of
individuality has been eliminated (for example, the word "I" has
disappeared from the language). As is common in her work, Rand
draws a clear distinction between the "socialist/communal" values
of equality and brotherhood and the "productive/capitalist" values
of achievement and individuality.<br />
Many of the novella's core themes, such as the struggle between
individualism and collectivism, are echoed in Rand's later books,
such as The Fountainhead and Atlas Shrugged. However, the style of
"Anthem" is unique among Rand's work, more narrative-centered and
economical, lacking the intense didactic expressions of
philosophical abstraction that occur in later works. It is probably
her most accessible work.</p>

Curious Case of Benjamin Button</em></a>
<p>This story was inspired by a remark of Mark Twain's to the
effect that it was a pity that the best part of life came at the
beginning and the worst part at the end. By trying the experiment
upon only one man in a perfectly normal world I have scarcely given
his idea a fair trial. Several weeks after completing it, I
discovered an almost identical plot in Samuel Butler's
"Note-books."<br />
The story was published in "Collier's" last summer and provoked
this startling letter from an anonymous admirer in
Cincinnati:<br />
"Sir--<br />
I have read the story Benjamin Button in Colliers and I wish to say
that as a short story writer you would make a good lunatic I have
seen many peices of cheese in my life but of all the peices of
cheese I have ever seen you are the biggest peice. I hate to waste
a peice of stationary on you but I will."</p>

<p>Jules is a young man barely a century old. He's lived long
enough to see the cure for death and the end of scarcity, to learn
ten languages and compose three symphonies...and to realize his
boyhood dream of taking up residence in Disney World.Disney World!
The greatest artistic achievement of the long-ago twentieth
century. Now in the keeping of a network of "ad-hocs" who keep the
classic attractions running as they always have, enhanced with only
the smallest high-tech touches.Now, though, the "ad hocs" are under
attack. A new group has taken over the Hall of the Presidents, and
is replacing its venerable audioanimatronics with new, immersive
direct-to-brain interfaces that give guests the illusion of being
Washington, Lincoln, and all the others. For Jules, this is an
attack on the artistic purity of Disney World itself. Worse: it
appears this new group has had Jules killed. This upsets him. (It's
only his fourth death and revival, after all.) Now it's war....</p>

of Cthulhu</em></a>
<p>"The Call of Cthulhu" is one of H. P. Lovecraft's best-known
short stories. Written in the summer of 1926, it was first
published in Weird Tales, February 1928. It is the only story
written by Lovecraft in which the extraterrestrial entity Cthulhu
himself makes a major appearance.<br />
It is written in a documentary style, with three independent
narratives linked together by the device of a narrator discovering
notes left by a deceased relative. The narrator pieces together the
whole truth and disturbing significance of the information he
possesses, illustrating the story's first line: "The most merciful
thing in the world, I think, is the inability of the human mind to
correlate all its contents. We live on a placid island of ignorance
in the midst of black seas of infinity; and it was not meant that
we should voyage far."</p>
