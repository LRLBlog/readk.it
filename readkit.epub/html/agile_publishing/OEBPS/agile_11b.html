Rather than a straight e-book version of the print catalogue though, the digital publication has unique content: Four companion essays to the show, written by the undergraduate students who&#8217;d helped organize it. Designed and edited to the same standards as the print catalogue, the companion essays were published as a simple PDF and offered for free download on the museum&#8217;s website.</span>			</div>		</div>		<!-- Copyright Â© 2013 Greg Albers.
