The magazine shared a common design with the hardcover and all the same content minus the backmatter. It was sold in the museum shop for $5. In <a href="http://www.artinamericamagazine.com/news-opinion/news/2013-03-14/ai-wei-wei-magazine/"><em>Art in America</em></a> Magazine, Deborah Horowitz, the Hirshhorn&#8217;s director of curatorial administration and publications said, &#8220;The magazine was produced with accessibility rather than profit in mind.
