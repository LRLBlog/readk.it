<p class="no-indent">A strange occurrence has taken place to-day. I
got up fairly late, and when Mawra brought me my clean boots, I
asked her how late it was. When I heard it had long struck ten, I
dressed as quickly as possible.</p>
<p>To tell the truth, I would rather not have gone to the office at
all to-day, for I know beforehand that our department-chief will
look as sour as vinegar. For some time past he has been in the
habit of saying to me, “Look here, my friend; there is something
wrong with your head. You often rush about as though you were
possessed. Then you make such confused abstracts of the documents
that the devil himself cannot make them out; you write the title
without any capital letters, and add neither the date nor the
docket-number.” The long-legged scoundrel! He is certainly envious
of me, because I sit in the director's work-room, and mend His
Excellency's pens. In a word, I should not have gone to the office
if I had not hoped to meet the accountant, and perhaps squeeze a
little advance out of this skinflint.</p>
<p><a class="pagenum" id="Page_108"></a>A terrible man, this
accountant! As for his advancing one's salary once in a way—you
might sooner expect the skies to fall. You may beg and beseech him,
and be on the very verge of ruin—this grey devil won't budge an
inch. At the same time, his own cook at home, as all the world
knows, boxes his ears.</p>
<p>I really don't see what good one gets by serving in our
department. There are no plums there. In the fiscal and judicial
offices it is quite different. There some ungainly fellow sits in a
corner and writes and writes; he has such a shabby coat and such an
ugly mug that one would like to spit on both of them. But you
should see what a splendid country-house he has rented. He would
not condescend to accept a gilt porcelain cup as a present. “You
can give that to your family doctor,” he would say. Nothing less
than a pair of chestnut horses, a fine carriage, or a beaver-fur
coat worth three hundred roubles would be good enough for him. And
yet he seems so mild and quiet, and asks so amiably, “Please lend
me your penknife; I wish to mend my pen.” Nevertheless, he knows
how to scarify a petitioner till he has hardly a whole stitch left
on his body.</p>
<p>In our office it must be admitted everything is done in a proper
and gentlemanly way; there is more cleanness and elegance than one
will ever find in Government offices. The tables&#160;<a class=
"pagenum" id="Page_109"></a>are mahogany, and everyone is addressed
as “sir.” And truly, were it not for this official propriety, I
should long ago have sent in my resignation.</p>
<p>I put on my old cloak, and took my umbrella, as a light rain was
falling. No one was to be seen on the streets except some women,
who had flung their skirts over their heads. Here and there one saw
a cabman or a shopman with his umbrella up. Of the higher classes
one only saw an official here and there. One I saw at the
street-crossing, and thought to myself, “Ah! my friend, you are not
going to the office, but after that young lady who walks in front
of you. You are just like the officers who run after every
petticoat they see.”</p>
<p>As I was thus following the train of my thoughts, I saw a
carriage stop before a shop just as I was passing it. I recognised
it at once; it was our director's carriage. “He has nothing to do
in the shop,” I said to myself; “it must be his daughter.”</p>
<p>I pressed myself close against the wall. A lackey opened the
carriage door, and, as I had expected, she fluttered like a bird
out of it. How proudly she looked right and left; how she drew her
eyebrows together, and shot lightnings from her eyes—good heavens!
I am lost, hopelessly lost!</p>
<p>But why must she come out in such abominable&#160;<a class=
"pagenum" id="Page_110"></a>weather? And yet they say women are so
mad on their finery!</p>
<p>She did not recognise me. I had wrapped myself as closely as
possible in my cloak. It was dirty and old-fashioned, and I would
not have liked to have been seen by her wearing it. Now they wear
cloaks with long collars, but mine has only a short double collar,
and the cloth is of inferior quality.</p>
<p>Her little dog could not get into the shop, and remained
outside. I know this dog; its name is “Meggy.”</p>
<p>Before I had been standing there a minute, I heard a voice call,
“Good day, Meggy!”</p>
<p>Who the deuce was that? I looked round and saw two ladies
hurrying by under an umbrella—one old, the other fairly young. They
had already passed me when I heard the same voice say again, “For
shame, Meggy!”</p>
<p>What was that? I saw Meggy sniffing at a dog which ran behind
the ladies. The deuce! I thought to myself, “I am not drunk? That
happens pretty seldom.”</p>
<p>“No, Fidel, you are wrong,” I heard Meggy say quite distinctly.
“I was—bow—wow!—I was—bow! wow! wow!—very ill.”</p>
<p>What an extraordinary dog! I was, to tell the truth, quite
amazed to hear it talk human language. But when I considered the
matter well, I ceased to be astonished. In fact,
such&#160;<a class="pagenum" id="Page_111"></a>things have already
happened in the world. It is said that in England a fish put its
head out of water and said a word or two in such an extraordinary
language that learned men have been puzzling over them for three
years, and have not succeeded in interpreting them yet. I also read
in the paper of two cows who entered a shop and asked for a pound
of tea.</p>
<p>Meanwhile what Meggy went on to say seemed to me still more
remarkable. She added, “I wrote to you lately, Fidel; perhaps
Polkan did not bring you the letter.”</p>
<p>Now I am willing to forfeit a whole month's salary if I ever
heard of dogs writing before. This has certainly astonished me. For
some little time past I hear and see things which no other man has
heard and seen.</p>
<p>“I will,” I thought, “follow that dog in order to get to the
bottom of the matter. Accordingly, I opened my umbrella and went
after the two ladies. They went down Bean Street, turned through
Citizen Street and Carpenter Street, and finally halted on the
Cuckoo Bridge before a large house. I know this house; it is
Sverkoff's. What a monster he is! What sort of people live there!
How many cooks, how many bagmen! There are brother officials of
mine also there packed on each other like herrings. And I have a
friend there, a fine player on the cornet.”</p>
<p><a class="pagenum" id="Page_112"></a>The ladies mounted to the
fifth story. “Very good,” thought I; “I will make a note of the
number, in order to follow up the matter at the first
opportunity.”</p>
