<p>I was at the theatre. “The Russian House-Fool” was performed. I
laughed heartily. There was also a kind of musical comedy which
contained amusing hits at barristers. The language was very broad;
I wonder the censor passed it. In the comedy lines occur which
accuse the merchants of cheating; their sons are said to lead
immoral lives, and to behave very disrespectfully towards the
nobility.</p>
<p>The critics also are criticised; they are said only to be able
to find fault, so that authors have to beg the public for
protection.</p>
<p>Our modern dramatists certainly write amusing things. I am very
fond of the theatre. If I have only a kopeck in my pocket, I always
go there. Most of my fellow-officials are uneducated boors, and
never enter a theatre unless one throws free tickets at their
head.</p>
<p>One actress sang divinely. I thought also of—but silence!</p>
