<p>I can never understand what kind of a country this Spain really
is. The popular customs and rules of court etiquette are quite
extraordinary. I do not understand them at all, at all. To-day my
head was shorn, although I exclaimed as loudly as I could, that I
did not want to be a monk. What happened afterwards, when they
began to let cold water trickle on my head, I do not know. I have
never experienced such hellish torments. I nearly went mad, and
they had difficulty in holding me. The significance of this strange
custom is entirely hidden from me. It is a very foolish and
unreasonable one.</p>
<p>Nor can I understand the stupidity of the kings who have not
done away with it before now. Judging by all the circumstances, it
seems to me as though I had fallen into the hands of the
Inquisition, and as though the man whom I took to be the Chancellor
was the Grand Inquisitor. But yet I cannot understand how the king
could fall into the hands of the Inquisition. The affair may have
been arranged by France—especially Polignac—he is a hound, that
Polignac! He has sworn to compass my death, and now he is hunting
me down. But I know, my friend, that you are only a tool of the
English. They are clever fellows, and have a finger in every pie.
All the world knows that France sneezes when England takes a pinch
of snuff.</p>
