<p>Our chief clerk has gone mad. When I came to the office to-day
he called me to his room and began as follows: “Look here, my
friend, what wild ideas have got into your head?”</p>
<p><a class="pagenum" id="Page_115"></a>“How! What? None at all,” I
answered.</p>
<p>“Consider well. You are already past forty; it is quite time to
be reasonable. What do you imagine? Do you think I don't know all
your tricks? Are you trying to pay court to the director's
daughter? Look at yourself and realise what you are! A nonentity,
nothing else. I would not give a kopeck for you. Look well in the
glass. How can you have such thoughts with such a caricature of a
face?”</p>
<p>May the devil take him! Because his own face has a certain
resemblance to a medicine-bottle, because he has a curly bush of
hair on his head, and sometimes combs it upwards, and sometimes
plasters it down in all kinds of queer ways, he thinks that he can
do everything. I know well, I know why he is angry with me. He is
envious; perhaps he has noticed the tokens of favour which have
been graciously shown me. But why should I bother about him? A
councillor! What sort of important animal is that? He wears a gold
chain with his watch, buys himself boots at thirty roubles a pair;
may the deuce take him! Am I a tailor's son or some other obscure
cabbage? I am a nobleman! I can also work my way up. I am just
forty-two—an age when a man's real career generally begins. Wait a
bit, my friend! I too may get to a superior's rank; or perhaps, if
God is gracious, even to a higher one. I shall make
a&#160;<a class="pagenum" id="Page_116"></a>name which will far
outstrip yours. You think there are no able men except yourself? I
only need to order a fashionable coat and wear a tie like yours,
and you would be quite eclipsed.</p>
<p>But I have no money—that is the worst part of it!</p>
