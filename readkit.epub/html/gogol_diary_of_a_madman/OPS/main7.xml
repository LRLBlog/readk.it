<p>Now let us see! The letter is fairly legible but the handwriting
is somewhat doggish.</p>
<hr class="space-break" />
<p><a class="pagenum" id="Page_121"></a>“Dear Fidel!—I cannot get
accustomed to your ordinary name, as if they could not have found a
better one for you! Fidel! How tasteless! How ordinary! But this is
not the time to discuss it. I am very glad that we thought of
corresponding with each other.”</p>
<p>(The letter is quite correctly written. The punctuation and
spelling are perfectly right. Even our head clerk does not write so
simply and clearly, though he declares he has been at the
University. Let us go on.)</p>
<p>“I think that it is one of the most refined joys of this world
to interchange thoughts, feelings, and impressions.”</p>
<p>(H'm! This idea comes from some book which has been translated
from German. I can't remember the title.)</p>
<p>“I speak from experience, although I have not gone farther into
the world than just before our front door. Does not my life pass
happily and comfortably? My mistress, whom her father calls Sophie,
is quite in love with me.”</p>
<p>(Ah! Ah!—but better be silent!)</p>
<p>“Her father also often strokes me. I drink tea and coffee with
cream. Yes, my dear, I must confess to you that I find no
satisfaction in those large, gnawed-at bones which Polkan devours
in the kitchen. Only the bones of wild fowl are good, and that only
when the marrow has not been sucked out of them. They taste very
nice&#160;<a class="pagenum" id="Page_122"></a>with a little sauce,
but there should be no green stuff in it. But I know nothing worse
than the habit of giving dogs balls of bread kneaded up. Someone
sits at table, kneads a bread-ball with dirty fingers, calls you
and sticks it in your mouth. Good manners forbid your refusing it,
and you eat it—with disgust it is true, but you eat it.”</p>
<p>(The deuce! What is this? What rubbish! As if she could find
nothing more suitable to write about! I will see if there is
anything more reasonable on the second page.)</p>
<p>“I am quite willing to inform you of everything that goes on
here. I have already mentioned the most important person in the
house, whom Sophie calls ‘Papa.’ He is a very strange man.”</p>
<p>(Ah! Here we are at last! Yes, I knew it; they have a
politician's penetrating eye for all things. Let us see what she
says about “Papa.”)</p>
<p>“…&#160;a strange man. Generally he is silent; he only speaks
seldom, but about a week ago he kept on repeating to himself,
‘Shall I get it or not?’ In one hand he took a sheet of paper; the
other he stretched out as though to receive something, and
repeated, ‘Shall I get it or not?’ Once he turned to me with the
question, ‘What do you think, Meggy?’ I did not understand in the
least what he meant, sniffed at his boots, and went away. A week
later he came home with his face beaming. That morning he was
visited&#160;<a class="pagenum" id="Page_123"></a>by several
officers in uniform who congratulated him. At the dinner-table he
was in a better humour than I have ever seen him before.”</p>
<p>(Ah! he is ambitious then! I must make a note of that.)</p>
<p>“Pardon, my dear, I hasten to conclude, etc., etc. To-morrow I
will finish the letter.”</p>
<p class="dot-break">… &#160;…</p>
<p>“Now, good morning; here I am again at your service. To-day my
mistress Sophie&#160;…”</p>
<p>(Ah! we will see what she says about Sophie. Let us go on!)</p>
<p>“…&#160;was in an unusually excited state. She went to a ball,
and I was glad that I could write to you in her absence. She likes
going to balls, although she gets dreadfully irritated while
dressing. I cannot understand, my dear, what is the pleasure in
going to a ball. She comes home from the ball at six o'clock in the
early morning, and to judge by her pale and emaciated face, she has
had nothing to eat. I could, frankly speaking, not endure such an
existence. If I could not get partridge with sauce, or the wing of
a roast chicken, I don't know what I should do. Porridge with sauce
is also tolerable, but I can get up no enthusiasm for carrots,
turnips, and artichokes.”</p>
<hr class="space-break" />
<p>The style is very unequal! One sees at once that it has not been
written by a man. The&#160;<a class="pagenum" id=
"Page_124"></a>beginning is quite intelligent, but at the end the
canine nature breaks out. I will read another letter; it is rather
long and there is no date.</p>
<hr class="space-break" />
<p>“Ah, my dear, how delightful is the arrival of spring! My heart
beats as though it expected something. There is a perpetual ringing
in my ears, so that I often stand with my foot raised, for several
minutes at a time, and listen towards the door. In confidence I
will tell you that I have many admirers. I often sit on the
window-sill and let them pass in review. Ah! if you knew what
miscreations there are among them; one, a clumsy house-dog, with
stupidity written on his face, walks the street with an important
air and imagines that he is an extremely important person, and that
the eyes of all the world are fastened on him. I don't pay him the
least attention, and pretend not to see him at all.</p>
<p>“And what a hideous bulldog has taken up his post opposite my
window! If he stood on his hind-legs, as the monster probably
cannot, he would be taller by a head than my mistress's papa, who
himself has a stately figure. This lout seems, moreover, to be very
impudent. I growl at him, but he does not seem to mind that at all.
If he at least would only wrinkle his forehead! Instead of that, he
stretches out his tongue, droops his big ears, and stares in at the
window—this rustic boor! But do you think, my dear,&#160;<a class=
"pagenum" id="Page_125"></a>that my heart remains proof against all
temptations? Alas no! If you had only seen that gentlemanly dog who
crept through the fence of the neighbouring house. ‘Treasure’ is
his name. Ah, my dear, what a delightful snout he has!”</p>
<p>(To the deuce with the stuff! What rubbish it is! How can one
blacken paper with such absurdities. Give me a man. I want to see a
man! I need some food to nourish and refresh my mind, and get this
silliness instead. I will turn the page to see if there is anything
better on the other side.)</p>
<p>“Sophie sat at the table and sewed something. I looked out of
the window and amused myself by watching the passers-by. Suddenly a
flunkey entered and announced a visitor—‘Mr Teploff.’</p>
<p>“‘Show him in!’ said Sophie, and began to embrace me. ‘Ah!
Meggy, Meggy, do you know who that is? He is dark, and belongs to
the Royal Household; and what eyes he has! Dark and brilliant as
fire.’</p>
<p>“Sophie hastened into her room. A minute later a young gentleman
with black whiskers entered. He went to the mirror, smoothed his
hair, and looked round the room. I turned away and sat down in my
place.</p>
<p>“Sophie entered and returned his bow in a friendly manner.</p>
<p>“I pretended to observe nothing, and continued&#160;<a class=
"pagenum" id="Page_126"></a>to look out of the window. But I leant
my head a little on one side to hear what they were talking about.
Ah, my dear! what silly things they discussed—how a lady executed
the wrong figure in dancing; how a certain Boboff, with his
expansive shirt-frill, had looked like a stork and nearly fallen
down; how a certain Lidina imagined she had blue eyes when they
were really green, etc.</p>
<p>“I do not know, my dear, what special charm she finds in her Mr
Teploff, and why she is so delighted with him.”</p>
<p>(It seems to me myself that there is something wrong here. It is
impossible that this Teploff should bewitch her. We will see
further.)</p>
<p>“If this gentleman of the Household pleases her, then she must
also be pleased, according to my view, with that official who sits
in her papa's writing-room. Ah, my dear, if you know what a figure
he is! A regular tortoise!”</p>
<p>(What official does she mean?)</p>
<p>“He has an extraordinary name. He always sits there and mends
the pens. His hair looks like a truss of hay. Her papa always
employs him instead of a servant.”</p>
<p>(I believe this abominable little beast is referring to me. But
what has my hair got to do with hay?)</p>
<p>“Sophie can never keep from laughing when she sees him.”</p>
<hr class="space-break" />
<p><a class="pagenum" id="Page_127"></a>You lie, cursed dog! What a
scandalous tongue! As if I did not know that it is envy which
prompts you, and that here there is treachery at work—yes, the
treachery of the chief clerk. This man hates me implacably; he has
plotted against me, he is always seeking to injure me. I'll look
through one more letter; perhaps it will make the matter
clearer.</p>
<hr class="space-break" />
<p>“Fidel, my dear, pardon me that I have not written for so long.
I was floating in a dream of delight. In truth, some author
remarks, ‘Love is a second life.’ Besides, great changes are going
on in the house. The young chamberlain is always here. Sophie is
wildly in love with him. Her papa is quite contented. I heard from
Gregor, who sweeps the floor, and is in the habit of talking to
himself, that the marriage will soon be celebrated. Her papa will
at any rate get his daughter married to a general, a colonel, or a
chamberlain.”</p>
<hr class="space-break" />
<p>Deuce take it! I can read no more. It is all about chamberlains
and generals. I should like myself to be a general—not in order to
sue for her hand and all that—no, not at all; I should like to be a
general merely in order to see people wriggling, squirming, and
hatching plots before me.</p>
<p>And then I should like to tell them that they are both of them
not worth spitting on. But it is&#160;<a class="pagenum" id=
"Page_128"></a>vexatious! I tear the foolish dog's letters up in a
thousand pieces.</p>
