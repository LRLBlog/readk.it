<p>So I am in Spain after all! It has happened so quickly that I
could hardly take it in. The Spanish deputies came early this
morning, and I got with them into the carriage. This unexpected
promptness seemed to me strange. We drove so quickly that in half
an hour we were at the Spanish frontier. Over all Europe now there
are cast-iron roads, and the steamers go very fast. A wonderful
country, this Spain!</p>
<p>As we entered the first room, I saw numerous persons with shorn
heads. I guessed at once that they must be either grandees or
soldiers, at least to judge by their shorn heads.</p>
<p><a class="pagenum" id="Page_136"></a>The Chancellor of the
State, who led me by the hand, seemed to me to behave in a very
strange way; he pushed me into a little room and said, “Stay here,
and if you call yourself ‘King Ferdinand’ again, I will drive the
wish to do so out of you.”</p>
<p>I knew, however, that that was only a test, and I reasserted my
conviction; on which the Chancellor gave me two such severe blows
with a stick on the back, that I could have cried out with the
pain. But I restrained myself, remembering that this was a usual
ceremony of old-time chivalry when one was inducted into a high
position, and in Spain the laws of chivalry prevail up to the
present day. When I was alone, I determined to study State affairs;
I discovered that Spain and China are one and the same country, and
it is only through ignorance that people regard them as separate
kingdoms. I&#160;advise&#160;everyone urgently to write down the
word “Spain” on a sheet of paper; he will see that it is quite the
same as China.</p>
<p>But I feel much annoyed by an event which is about to take place
to-morrow; at seven o'clock the earth is going to sit on the moon.
This is foretold by the famous English chemist, Wellington. To tell
the truth, I often felt uneasy when I thought of the excessive
brittleness and fragility of the moon. The moon is generally
repaired in Hamburg, and very imperfectly. It&#160;<a class=
"pagenum" id="Page_137"></a>is done by a lame cooper, an obvious
blockhead who has no idea how to do it. He took waxed thread and
olive-oil—hence that pungent smell over all the earth which compels
people to hold their noses. And this makes the moon so fragile that
no men can live on it, but only noses. Therefore we cannot see our
noses, because they are on the moon.</p>
<p>When I now pictured to myself how the earth, that massive body,
would crush our noses to dust, if it sat on the moon, I became so
uneasy, that I immediately put on my shoes and stockings and
hastened into the council-hall to give the police orders to prevent
the&#160;earth&#160;sitting on the&#160;moon.</p>
<p>The grandees with the shorn heads, whom I met in great numbers
in the hall, were very intelligent people, and when I exclaimed,
“Gentlemen! let us save the moon, for the earth is going to sit on
it,” they all set to work to fulfil my imperial wish, and many of
them clambered up the wall in order to take the moon down. At that
moment the Imperial Chancellor came in. As soon as he appeared,
they all scattered, but I alone, as king, remained. To my
astonishment, however, the Chancellor beat me with the stick and
drove me to my room. So powerful are ancient customs in Spain!</p>
