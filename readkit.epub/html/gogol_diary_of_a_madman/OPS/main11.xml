<p>To-day is a day of splendid triumph. Spain has a king; he has
been found, and I am he. I discovered it to-day; all of a sudden it
came upon me like a flash of lightning.</p>
<p>I do not understand how I could imagine that I am a titular
councillor. How could such a foolish idea enter my head? It was
fortunate that it occurred to no one to shut me up in an asylum.
Now it is all clear, and as plain as a pikestaff. Formerly—I don't
know why—everything seemed veiled in a kind of mist. That is, I
believe, because people think that the human brain is in the head.
Nothing of the sort; it is carried by the wind from the Caspian
Sea.</p>
<p><a class="pagenum" id="Page_131"></a>For the first time I told
Mawra who I am. When she learned that the king of Spain stood
before her, she struck her hands together over her head, and nearly
died of alarm. The stupid thing had never seen the king of Spain
before!</p>
<p>I comforted her, however, at once by assuring her that I was not
angry with her for having hitherto cleaned my boots badly. Women
are stupid things; one cannot interest them in lofty subjects. She
was frightened because she thought all kings of Spain were like
Philip&#160;II. But I explained to her that there was a great
difference between me and him. I did not go to the office. Why the
deuce should I? No, my dear friends, you won't get me there again!
I am not going to worry myself with your infernal documents any
more.</p>
