<p>To-day about two o'clock in the afternoon I started in order, by
some means or other, to see Fidel and question her.</p>
<p>I cannot stand this smell of Sauerkraut which assails one's
olfactory nerves from all the shops in Citizen Street. There also
exhales such an odour from under each house door, that one must
hold one's nose and pass by quickly. There ascends also so much
smoke and soot from the artisans' shops that it is almost
impossible to get through it.</p>
<p>When I had climbed up to the sixth story, and had rung the bell,
a rather pretty girl with a freckled face came out. I recognised
her as the companion of the old lady. She blushed a little and
asked “What do you want?”</p>
<p>“I want to have a little conversation with your dog.”</p>
<p>She was a simple-minded girl, as I saw at once. The dog came
running and barking loudly. I wanted to take hold of it, but the
abominable beast nearly caught hold of my nose with its teeth. But
in a corner of the room I saw its sleeping-basket. Ah! that was
what I wanted. I went to it, rummaged in the straw, and to my great
satisfaction drew out a little packet of small&#160;<a class=
"pagenum" id="Page_120"></a>pieces of paper. When the hideous
little dog saw this, it first bit me in the calf of the leg, and
then, as soon as it had become aware of my theft, it began to
whimper and to fawn on me; but I said, “No, you little beast;
good-bye!” and hastened away.</p>
<p>I believe the girl thought me mad; at any rate she was
thoroughly alarmed.</p>
<p>When I reached my room I wished to get to work at once, and read
through the letters by daylight, since I do not see well by
candle-light; but the wretched Mawra had got the idea of sweeping
the floor. These blockheads of Finnish women are always clean where
there is no need to be.</p>
<p>I then went for a little walk and began to think over what had
happened. Now at last I could get to the bottom of all facts, ideas
and motives! These letters would explain everything. Dogs are
clever fellows; they know all about politics, and I will certainly
find in the letters all I want, especially the character of the
director and all his relationships. And through these letters I
will get information about her who—but silence!</p>
<p>Towards evening I came home and lay for a good while on the
bed.</p>
