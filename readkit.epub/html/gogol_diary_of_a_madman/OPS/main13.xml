<p>I went for a walk incognito on the Nevski Prospect. I avoided
every appearance of being the king of Spain. I felt it below my
dignity to let myself be recognised by the whole world, since I
must first present myself at court. And I was also restrained by
the fact that I have at present no Spanish national costume. If I
could only get a cloak! I tried to have a consultation with a
tailor, but these people are real asses! Moreover, they neglect
their business, dabble in speculation, and have become loafers. I
will have a cloak made out of my new official uniform which I have
only worn twice. But to prevent this botcher of a tailor spoiling
it, I will make it myself with closed doors, so that no one sees
me. Since the cut must be altogether altered, I have used the
scissors myself.</p>

<p>I don't remember the date. The devil knows what month it was.
The cloak is quite ready. Mawra exclaimed aloud when I put it on. I
will, however, not present myself at court yet; the Spanish
deputation has not yet arrived. It would not be befitting if I
appeared without&#160;<a class="pagenum" id="Page_135"></a>them. My
appearance would be less imposing. From hour to hour I expect
them.</p>
