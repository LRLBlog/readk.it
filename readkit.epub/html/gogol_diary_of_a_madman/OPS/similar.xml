Complete Plato</em></a>
<p>Plato (428/427–348/347 BCE) was a Greek philosopher and
mathematician of the Classic Age who founded the Academy of Athens.
Noted as a student of Socrates, Plato has distinguished himself as
one of the founders of Western philosophy by recording the
teachings of his master and his own philosophies in 35 dialogues
and 13 letters (some are disputed as spurious). However, this
collection features only 25 authentic works from the reproduced
source.</p>
<p>Benjamin Jowett is credited for translating these works into
English. While there are many websites online where one may find
digital copies of his translations, the source of the copies
reproduced for this publication may be found at the online library
of the University of Adelaide in South Australia, usable under the

Picture of Dorian Gray</em></a>
<p>Oscar Wilde's story of a fashionable young man who sells his
soul for eternal youth and beauty is one of his most popular works.
Written in Wilde's characteristically dazzling manner, full of
stinging epigrams and shrewd observations, the tale of Dorian
Gray's moral disintegration caused something of a scandal when it
first appeared in 1890. Wilde was attacked for his decadence and
corrupting influence, and a few years later the book and the
aesthetic/moral dilemma it presented became issues in the trials
occasioned by Wilde's homosexual liaisons, trials that resulted in
his imprisonment. Of the book's value as autobiography, Wilde noted
in a letter, "Basil Hallward is what I think I am: Lord Henry what
the world thinks me: Dorian what I would like to be--in other ages,
perhaps."</p>

Kama Sutra</em></a>
<p>The Kama Sutra, is an ancient Indian text widely considered to
be the standard work on human sexual behavior in Sanskrit
literature written by the Indian scholar Vatsyayana. A portion of
the work consists of practical advice on sex. Kāma means sensual or
sexual pleasure, and sūtra are the guidlines of yoga, the word
itself means thread in Sanskrit.<br />
The Kama Sutra is the oldest and most notable of a group of texts
known generically as Kama Shastra). Traditionally, the first
transmission of Kama Shastra or "Discipline of Kama" is attributed
to Nandi the sacred bull, Shiva's doorkeeper, who was moved to
sacred utterance by overhearing the lovemaking of the god and his
wife Parvati and later recorded his utterances for the benefit of
mankind.</p>

Sorrows of Satan</em></a>
<p>The Sorrows of Satan is an 1895 faustian novel by Marie Corelli.
It is widely regarded as one of the world's first bestsellers,
partly due to an upheaval in the system British libraries used to
purchase their books and partly due to its popular appeal. Roundly
condemned by critics for Corelli's moralistic and prosaic style it
nonetheless had strong supporters in Oscar Wilde and various
members of royalty. Widely ignored in literary circles, it is
increasingly regarded as an influential fin de siècle text. The
book is occasionally subtitled "Or the Strange Experience of one
Geoffrey Tempest, Millionaire".</p>

It</em></a>
<p>Roughing It follows the travels of young Mark Twain through the
Wild West during the years 1861–1867. After a brief stint as a
Confederate cavalry militiaman, he joined his brother Orion
Clemens, who had been appointed Secretary of the Nevada Territory,
on a stagecoach journey west. Twain consulted his brother's diary
to refresh his memory and borrowed heavily from his active
imagination for many stories in the novel.</p>
<p>Roughing It illustrates many of Twain's early adventures,
including a visit to Salt Lake City, gold and silver prospecting,
real-estate speculation, and his beginnings as a writer.</p>
<p>In this memoir, readers can see examples of Twain's rough-hewn
humor, which would become a staple of his writing in his later
books, such as Adventures of Huckleberry Finn, The Adventures of
Tom Sawyer, and A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court.</p>

<a href="http://generation.feedbooks.com/book/5543.epub"><em>The
Great Gatsby</em></a>
<p>In 1922, F. Scott Fitzgerald announced his decision to write
"something new--something extraordinary and beautiful and simple +
intricately patterned." That extraordinary, beautiful, intricately
patterned, and above all, simple novel became The Great Gatsby,
arguably Fitzgerald's finest work and certainly the book for which
he is best known. A portrait of the Jazz Age in all of its
decadence and excess, Gatsby captured the spirit of the author's
generation and earned itself a permanent place in American
mythology. Self-made, self-invented millionaire Jay Gatsby embodies
some of Fitzgerald's--and his country's--most abiding obsessions:
money, ambition, greed, and the promise of new beginnings. "Gatsby
believed in the green light, the orgiastic future that year by year
recedes before us. It eluded us then, but that's no
matter--tomorrow we will run faster, stretch out our arms
farther.... And one fine morning--" Gatsby's rise to glory and
eventual fall from grace becomes a kind of cautionary tale about
the American Dream.</p>
<p>It's also a love story, of sorts, the narrative of Gatsby's
quixotic passion for Daisy Buchanan. The pair meet five years
before the novel begins, when Daisy is a legendary young Louisville
beauty and Gatsby an impoverished officer. They fall in love, but
while Gatsby serves overseas, Daisy marries the brutal, bullying,
but extremely rich Tom Buchanan. After the war, Gatsby devotes
himself blindly to the pursuit of wealth by whatever means--and to
the pursuit of Daisy, which amounts to the same thing. "Her voice
is full of money," Gatsby says admiringly, in one of the novel's
more famous descriptions. His millions made, Gatsby buys a mansion
across Long Island Sound from Daisy's patrician East Egg address,
throws lavish parties, and waits for her to appear. When she does,
events unfold with all the tragic inevitability of a Greek drama,
with detached, cynical neighbor Nick Carraway acting as chorus
throughout. Spare, elegantly plotted, and written in crystalline
prose, The Great Gatsby is as perfectly satisfying as the best kind
of poem.</p>
<p>* * *</p>
<p>"Now we have an American masterpiece in its final form: the
original crystal has shaped itself into the true diamond. This is
the novel as Fitzgerald wished it to be, and so it is what we have
dreamed of, sleeping and waking." -- James Dickey</p>
<p>* * *</p>
<p>The Great Gatsby is a novel by the American author F. Scott
Fitzgerald. First published on April 10, 1925, it is set on Long
Island's North Shore and in New York City during the summer of
1922.</p>
<p>The novel takes place following the First World War. American
society enjoyed prosperity during the "roaring" 1920s as the
economy soared. At the same time, Prohibition, the ban on the sale
and manufacture of alcohol as mandated by the Eighteenth Amendment,
made millionaires out of bootleggers. After its republishing in
1945 and 1953, it quickly found a wide readership and is today
widely regarded as a paragon of the Great American Novel, and a
literary classic. The Great Gatsby has become a standard text in
high school and university courses on American literature in
countries around the world, and is ranked second in the Modern
Library's lists of the 100 Best Novels of the 20th Century.</p>

<p>Jules is a young man barely a century old. He's lived long
enough to see the cure for death and the end of scarcity, to learn
ten languages and compose three symphonies...and to realize his
boyhood dream of taking up residence in Disney World.Disney World!
The greatest artistic achievement of the long-ago twentieth
century. Now in the keeping of a network of "ad-hocs" who keep the
classic attractions running as they always have, enhanced with only
the smallest high-tech touches.Now, though, the "ad hocs" are under
attack. A new group has taken over the Hall of the Presidents, and
is replacing its venerable audioanimatronics with new, immersive
direct-to-brain interfaces that give guests the illusion of being
Washington, Lincoln, and all the others. For Jules, this is an
attack on the artistic purity of Disney World itself. Worse: it
appears this new group has had Jules killed. This upsets him. (It's
only his fourth death and revival, after all.) Now it's war....</p>

<p>Manifesto of the Communist Party (German: Manifest der
Kommunistischen Partei), often referred to as The Communist
Manifesto, was first published on February 21, 1848, and is one of
the world's most influential political manuscripts. Commissioned by
the Communist League and written by communist theorists Karl Marx
and Friedrich Engels, it laid out the League's purposes and
program. The Manifesto suggested a course of action for a
proletarian (working class) revolution to overthrow the bourgeois
social order and to eventually bring about a classless and
stateless society, and the abolition of private property.</p>
