<p>To-day I sat in the director's room, mended twenty-three pens
for him, and for Her—for Her Excellence, his daughter, four
more.</p>
<p>The director likes to see many pens lying on his table. What a
head he must have! He continually wraps himself in silence, but I
don't think the smallest trifle escapes his eye. I should like to
know what he is generally thinking of, what is really going on in
this brain; I should like to get acquainted with the whole manner
of life of these gentlemen, and get a closer view of their cunning
courtiers' arts, and all the activities of these circles. I have
often thought of asking His Excellence about them; but—the deuce
knows why!—every time my tongue failed me and I could get nothing
out but my meteorological report.</p>
<p>I wish I could get a look into the spare-room whose door I so
often see open. And a second small room behind the spare-room
excites my curiosity. How splendidly it is fitted up; what a
quantity of mirrors and choice china it contains! I should also
like to cast a glance into those&#160;<a class="pagenum" id=
"Page_118"></a>regions where Her Excellency, the daughter, wields
the sceptre. I should like to see how all the scent-bottles and
boxes are arranged in her boudoir, and the flowers which exhale so
delicious a scent that one is half afraid to breathe. And her
clothes lying about which are too ethereal to be called clothes—but
silence!</p>
<p>To-day there came to me what seemed a heavenly inspiration. I
remembered the conversation between the two dogs which I had
overheard on the Nevski Prospect. “Very good,” I thought; “now I
see my way clear. I must get hold of the correspondence which these
two silly dogs have carried on with each other. In it I shall
probably find many things explained.”</p>
<p>I had already once called Meggy to me and said to her, “Listen,
Meggy! Now we are alone together; if you like, I will also shut the
door so that no one can see us. Tell me now all that you know about
your mistress. I swear to you that I will tell no one.”</p>
<p>But the cunning dog drew in its tail, ruffled up its hair, and
went quite quietly out of the door, as though it had heard
nothing.</p>
<p>I had long been of the opinion that dogs are much cleverer than
men. I also believed that they could talk, and that only a certain
obstinacy kept them from doing so. They are especially watchful
animals, and nothing escapes their observation. Now, cost what it
may, I will go&#160;<a class="pagenum" id="Page_119"></a>to-morrow
to Sverkoff's house in order to ask after Fidel, and if I have
luck, to get hold of all the letters which Meggy has written to
her.</p>
