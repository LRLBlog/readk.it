<p>To-day I have been reading papers the whole morning. Very
strange things are happening in Spain. I have not understood them
all. It is said that the throne is vacant, the representatives of
the people are in difficulties about finding an occupant, and riots
are taking place.</p>
<p>All this appears to me very strange. How can the throne be
vacant? It is said that it will be occupied by a woman. A woman
cannot sit on a throne. That is impossible. Only a king can sit on
a throne. They say that there is no king there, but that is not
possible. There cannot be a kingdom without a king. There must be a
king, but he is hidden away somewhere. Perhaps he is actually on
the spot, and only some domestic complications, or fears of the
neighbouring Powers, France and other countries, compel him to
remain in concealment; there might also be other reasons.</p>
