<p>No, I have no longer power to endure. O God! what are they going
to do with me? They pour cold water on my head. They take no notice
of me, and seem neither to see nor hear. Why do they torture me?
What do they want from one so wretched as myself? What can I give
them? I possess&#160;<a class="pagenum" id="Page_140"></a>nothing.
I cannot bear all their tortures; my head aches as though
everything were turning round in a circle. Save me! Carry me away!
Give me three steeds swift as the wind! Mount your seat, coachman,
ring bells, gallop horses, and carry me straight out of this world.
Farther, ever farther, till nothing more is to be seen!</p>
<p>Ah! the heaven bends over me already; a star glimmers in the
distance; the forest with its dark trees in the moonlight rushes
past; a bluish mist floats under my feet; music sounds in the
cloud; on the one side is the sea, on the other, Italy; beyond I
also see Russian peasants' houses. Is not my parents' house there
in the distance? Does not my mother sit by the window? O mother,
mother, save your unhappy son! Let a tear fall on his aching head!
See how they torture him! Press the poor orphan to your bosom! He
has no rest in this world; they hunt him from place to place.</p>
<p>Mother, mother, have pity on your sick child! And do you know
that the Bey of Algiers has a wart under his nose?</p>
