<div class="text">
<p>To-day the office-messenger came and summoned me, as I had not
been there for three weeks. I went just for the fun of the thing.
The chief clerk thought I would bow humbly before him, and make
excuses; but I looked at him quite indifferently, neither angrily
nor mildly, and sat down quietly at my place as though I noticed no
one. I looked at all this rabble of scribblers, and thought, “If
you only knew who is sitting among you! Good heavens! what a to-do
you&#160;<a class="pagenum" id="Page_132"></a>would make. Even the
chief clerk would bow himself to the earth before me as he does now
before the director.”</p>
<p>A pile of reports was laid before me, of which to make
abstracts, but I did not touch them with one finger.</p>
<p>After a little time there was a commotion in the office, and
there a report went round that the director was coming. Many of the
clerks vied with each other to attract his notice; but I did not
stir. As he came through our room, each one hastily buttoned up his
coat; but I had no idea of doing anything of the sort. What is the
director to me? Should I stand up before him? Never. What sort of a
director is he? He is a bottle-stopper, and no director. A quite
ordinary, simple bottle-stopper—nothing more. I felt quite amused
as they gave me a document to sign.</p>
<p>They thought I would simply put down my name—“So-and-so, Clerk.”
Why not? But at the top of the sheet, where the director generally
writes his name, I inscribed “Ferdinand&#160;VIII.” in bold
characters. You should have seen what a reverential silence ensued.
But I made a gesture with my hand, and said, “Gentlemen, no
ceremony please!” Then I went out, and took my way straight to the
director's house.</p>
<p>He was not at home. The flunkey wanted not&#160;<a class=
"pagenum" id="Page_133"></a>to let me in, but I talked to him in
such a way that he soon dropped his arms.</p>
<p>I went straight to Sophie's dressing-room. She sat before the
mirror. When she saw me, she sprang up and took a step backwards;
but I did not tell her that I was the king of Spain.</p>
<p>But I told her that a happiness awaited her, beyond her power to
imagine; and that in spite of all our enemies' devices we should be
united. That was all which I wished to say to her, and I went out.
Oh, what cunning creatures these women are! Now I have found out
what woman really is. Hitherto no one knew whom a woman really
loves; I am the first to discover it—she loves the devil. Yes,
joking apart, learned men write nonsense when they pronounce that
she is this and that; she loves the devil—that is all. You see a
woman looking through her lorgnette from a box in the front row.
One thinks she is watching that stout gentleman who wears an order.
Not a bit of it! She is watching the devil who stands behind his
back. He has hidden himself there, and beckons to her with his
finger. And she marries him—actually—she marries him!</p>
<p>That is all ambition, and the reason is that there is under the
tongue a little blister in which there is a little worm of the size
of a pin's head. And this is constructed by a barber in Bean
Street; I don't remember his name at the&#160;<a class="pagenum"
id="Page_134"></a>moment, but so much is certain that, in
conjunction with a midwife, he wants to spread Mohammedanism all
over the world, and that in consequence of this a large number of
people in France have already adopted the faith of Islam.</p>
