<p>It is not possible that the marriage should take place; it is
only idle gossip. What does it signify if he is a chamberlain! That
is only a dignity, not a substantial thing which one can see or
handle. His chamberlain's office will not procure him a third eye
in his forehead. Neither is his nose made of gold; it is just like
mine or anyone else's nose. He does not eat and cough, but smells
and sneezes with it. I should like to get to the bottom of the
mystery—whence do all these distinctions come? Why am I only a
titular councillor?</p>
<p>Perhaps I am really a count or a general, and only appear to be
a titular councillor. Perhaps I don't even know who and what I am.
How many cases there are in history of a simple gentleman, or even
a burgher or peasant, suddenly turning out to be a great lord or
baron? Well, suppose that I appear suddenly in a general's uniform,
on the right shoulder an epaulette, on the left an epaulette, and a
blue sash across my breast, what sort of a tune would my beloved
sing then? What would her papa, our director, say? Oh, he is
ambitious! He is a freemason, certainly a freemason; however much
he may conceal it, I have found it out. When he gives anyone his
hand, he only reaches&#160;<a class="pagenum" id="Page_129"></a>out
two fingers. Well, could not I this minute be nominated a general
or a superintendent? I should like to know why I am a titular
councillor—why just that, and nothing more?</p>
