<p>To-day is Wednesday, and I was as usual in the office. I came
early on purpose, sat down, and mended all the pens.</p>
<p>Our director must be a very clever man. The whole room is full
of bookcases. I read the titles of some of the books; they were
very learned, beyond the comprehension of people of my class, and
all in French and German. I look at his face; see! how much dignity
there is in his eyes. I never hear a single superfluous word from
his mouth, except that when he hands over the documents, he asks
“What sort of weather is it?”</p>
<p>No, he is not a man of our class; he is a real statesman. I have
already noticed that I am a special favourite of his. If now his
daughter also—ah! what folly—let me say no more about it!</p>
<p>I have read the&#160;<em>Northern Bee</em>. What foolish people
the French are! By heavens! I should like to tackle them all, and
give them a thrashing. I have also read a fine description of a
ball given by a landowner of Kursk. The landowners of Kursk write a
fine style.</p>
<p>Then I noticed that it was already half-past&#160;<a class=
"pagenum" id="Page_113"></a>twelve, and the director had not yet
left his bedroom. But about half-past one something happened which
no pen can describe.</p>
<p>The door opened. I thought it was the director; I jumped up with
my documents from the seat, and—then—she—herself—came into the
room. Ye saints! how beautifully she was dressed. Her garments were
whiter than a swan's plumage—oh how splendid! A sun, indeed, a real
sun!</p>
<p>She greeted me and asked, “Has not my father come yet?”</p>
<p>Ah! what a voice. A canary bird! A real canary bird!</p>
<p>“Your Excellency,” I wanted to exclaim, “don't have me executed,
but if it must be done, then kill me rather with your own angelic
hand.” But, God knows why, I could not bring it out, so I only
said, “No, he has not come yet.”</p>
<p>She glanced at me, looked at the books, and let her handkerchief
fall. Instantly I started up, but slipped on the infernal polished
floor, and nearly broke my nose. Still I succeeded in picking up
the handkerchief. Ye heavenly choirs, what a handkerchief! So
tender and soft, of the finest cambric. It had the scent of a
general's rank!</p>
<p>She thanked me, and smiled so amiably that her sugar lips nearly
melted. Then she left the room.</p>
<p><a class="pagenum" id="Page_114"></a>After I had sat there about
an hour, a flunkey came in and said, “You can go home, Mr
Ivanovitch; the director has already gone out!”</p>
<p>I cannot stand these lackeys! They hang about the vestibules,
and scarcely vouchsafe to greet one with a nod. Yes, sometimes it
is even worse; once one of these rascals offered me his snuff-box
without even getting up from his chair. “Don't you know then, you
country-bumpkin, that I am an official and of aristocratic
birth?”</p>
<p>This time, however, I took my hat and overcoat quietly; these
people naturally never think of helping one on with it. I went
home, lay a good while on the bed, and wrote some verses in my
note:</p>
<div class="poetry width175">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="line">“'Tis an hour since I saw thee,</div>
<div class="line indent3">And it seems a whole long year;</div>
<div class="line indent1">If I loathe my own existence,</div>
<div class="line indent3">How can I live on, my dear?”</div>
</div>
</div>
<p class="no-indent">I think they are by Pushkin.</p>
<p>In the evening I wrapped myself in my cloak, hastened to the
director's house, and waited there a long time to see if she would
come out and get into the carriage. I only wanted to see her once,
but she did not come.</p>
