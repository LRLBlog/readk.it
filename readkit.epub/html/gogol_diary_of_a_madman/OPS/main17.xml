<p>To-day the Grand Inquisitor came into my room; when I heard his
steps in the distance, I hid myself under a chair. When he did not
see me, he began to call. At first he called “Poprishchin!” I made
no answer. Then he called “Axanti Ivanovitch! Titular Councillor!
Nobleman!” I still kept silence. “Ferdinand the Eighth, King of
Spain!” I was on the point of putting out my head, but I thought,
“No, brother, you shall not deceive me! You shall not pour water on
my head again!”</p>
<p>But he had already seen me and drove me from under the chair
with his stick. The cursed stick really hurts one. But the
following discovery compensated me for all the pain, i.e. that
every cock has his Spain under his feathers. The Grand Inquisitor
went angrily away, and threatened me with some punishment or other.
I felt only contempt for his powerless spite, for I know that he
only works like a machine, like a tool of the English.</p>
