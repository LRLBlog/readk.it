Canterville Ghost</em></a>
<p>The Canterville Ghost is a popular 1887 novella by Oscar Wilde,
widely adapted for the screen and stage.<br />
“The Canterville Ghost” is a parody featuring a dramatic spirit
named Sir Simon and the United States minister (ambassador) to the
Court of St. James's, Hiram B. Otis. Mr. Otis travels to England
with his family and moves into a haunted country house. Lord
Canterville, the previous owner of the house, warns Mr. Otis that
the ghost of Sir Simon de Canterville has haunted it ever since he
killed his wife, Eleonore, three centuries before. But Mr. Otis
dismisses the ghost story as bunk and disregards Lord Canterville’s
warnings. When the Otises learn that the house is indeed haunted,
they succeed in victimizing the ghost and in disregarding age-old
British traditions. What emerges is a satire of American
materialism, a lampoon of traditional British values, and an
amusing twist on the traditional gothic horror tale.</p>

Picture of Dorian Gray</em></a>
<p>Oscar Wilde's story of a fashionable young man who sells his
soul for eternal youth and beauty is one of his most popular works.
Written in Wilde's characteristically dazzling manner, full of
stinging epigrams and shrewd observations, the tale of Dorian
Gray's moral disintegration caused something of a scandal when it
first appeared in 1890. Wilde was attacked for his decadence and
corrupting influence, and a few years later the book and the
aesthetic/moral dilemma it presented became issues in the trials
occasioned by Wilde's homosexual liaisons, trials that resulted in
his imprisonment. Of the book's value as autobiography, Wilde noted
in a letter, "Basil Hallward is what I think I am: Lord Henry what
the world thinks me: Dorian what I would like to be--in other ages,
perhaps."</p>

Importance of Being Earnest</em></a>
<p>Set in England during the late Victorian era, the play's humour
derives in part from characters maintaining fictitious identities
to escape unwelcome social obligations. It is replete with witty
dialogue and satirizes some of the foibles and hypocrisy of late
Victorian society. It has proved Wilde's most enduringly popular
play.</p>

Adventures in Wonderland</em></a>
<p>Alice's Adventures in Wonderland (1865) is a novel written by
English author Charles Lutwidge Dodgson, better known under the
pseudonym Lewis Carroll. It tells the story of a girl named Alice
who falls down a rabbit-hole into a fantasy world populated by
peculiar and anthropomorphic creatures.<br />
The tale is filled with allusions to Dodgson's friends (and
enemies), and to the lessons that British schoolchildren were
expected to memorize. The tale plays with logic in ways that have
made the story of lasting popularity with adults as well as
children. It is considered to be one of the most characteristic
examples of the genre of literary nonsense, and its narrative
course and structure has been enormously influential, mainly in the
fantasy genre.</p>

the Looking Glass (And What Alice Found There)</em></a>
<p>Through the Looking-Glass, and What Alice Found There (1871) is
a work of children's literature by Lewis Carroll (Charles Lutwidge
Dodgson), generally categorized as literary nonsense. It is the
sequel to Alice's Adventures in Wonderland (1865). Although it
makes no reference to the events in the earlier book, the themes
and settings of Through the Looking-Glass make it a kind of mirror
image of Wonderland: the first book begins outdoors, in the warm
month of May, on Alice's birthday (May 4), uses frequent changes in
size as a plot device, and draws on the imagery of playing cards;
the second opens indoors on a snowy, wintry night exactly six
months later, on November 4 (the day before Guy Fawkes Night), uses
frequent changes in time and spatial directions as a plot device,
and draws on the imagery of chess. In it, there are many mirror
themes, including opposites, time running backwards, and so on.</p>
