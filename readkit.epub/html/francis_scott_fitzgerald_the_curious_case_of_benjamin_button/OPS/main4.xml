<p>In 1880 Benjamin Button was twenty years old, and he signalised
his birthday by going to work for his father in Roger Button &amp;
Co., Wholesale Hardware. It was in that same year that he began
"going out socially"—that is, his father insisted on taking him to
several fashionable dances. Roger Button was now fifty, and he and
his son were more and more companionable—in fact, since Benjamin
had ceased to dye his hair (which was still grayish) they appeared
about the same age, and could have passed for brothers.</p>
<p>One night in August they got into the phaeton attired in their
full-dress suits and drove out to a dance at the Shevlins' country
house, situated just outside of Baltimore. It was a gorgeous
evening. A full moon drenched the road to the lustreless colour of
platinum, and late-blooming harvest flowers breathed into the
motionless air aromas that were like low, half-heard laughter. The
open country, carpeted for rods around with bright wheat, was
translucent as in the day. It was almost impossible not to be
affected by the sheer beauty of the sky—almost.</p>
<p>"There's a great future in the dry-goods business," Roger Button
was saying. He was not a spiritual man—his aesthetic sense was
rudimentary.</p>
<p>"Old fellows like me can't learn new tricks," he observed
profoundly. "It's you youngsters with energy and vitality that have
the great future before you."</p>
<p>Far up the road the lights of the Shevlins' country house
drifted into view, and presently there was a sighing sound that
crept persistently toward them—it might have been the fine plaint
of violins or the rustle of the silver wheat under the moon.</p>
<p>They pulled up behind a handsome brougham whose passengers were
disembarking at the door. A lady got out, then an elderly
gentleman, then another young lady, beautiful as sin. Benjamin
started; an almost chemical change seemed to dissolve and recompose
the very elements of his body. A rigour passed over him, blood rose
into his cheeks, his forehead, and there was a steady thumping in
his ears. It was first love.</p>
<p>The girl was slender and frail, with hair that was ashen under
the moon and honey-coloured under the sputtering gas-lamps of the
porch. Over her shoulders was thrown a Spanish mantilla of softest
yellow, butterflied in black; her feet were glittering buttons at
the hem of her bustled dress.</p>
<p>Roger Button leaned over to his son. "That," he said, "is young
Hildegarde Moncrief, the daughter of General Moncrief."</p>
<p>Benjamin nodded coldly. "Pretty little thing," he said
indifferently. But when the negro boy had led the buggy away, he
added: "Dad, you might introduce me to her."</p>
<p>They approached a group, of which Miss Moncrief was the centre.
Reared in the old tradition, she curtsied low before Benjamin. Yes,
he might have a dance. He thanked her and walked away—staggered
away.</p>
<p>The interval until the time for his turn should arrive dragged
itself out interminably. He stood close to the wall, silent,
inscrutable, watching with murderous eyes the young bloods of
Baltimore as they eddied around Hildegarde Moncrief, passionate
admiration in their faces. How obnoxious they seemed to Benjamin;
how intolerably rosy! Their curling brown whiskers aroused in him a
feeling equivalent to indigestion.</p>
<p>But when his own time came, and he drifted with her out upon the
changing floor to the music of the latest waltz from Paris, his
jealousies and anxieties melted from him like a mantle of snow.
Blind with enchantment, he felt that life was just beginning.</p>
<p>"You and your brother got here just as we did, didn't you?"
asked Hildegarde, looking up at him with eyes that were like bright
blue enamel.</p>
<p>Benjamin hesitated. If she took him for his father's brother,
would it be best to enlighten her? He remembered his experience at
Yale, so he decided against it. It would be rude to contradict a
lady; it would be criminal to mar this exquisite occasion with the
grotesque story of his origin. Later, perhaps. So he nodded,
smiled, listened, was happy.</p>
<p>"I like men of your age," Hildegarde told him. "Young boys are
so idiotic. They tell me how much champagne they drink at college,
and how much money they lose playing cards. Men of your age know
how to appreciate women."</p>
<p>Benjamin felt himself on the verge of a proposal—with an effort
he choked back the impulse. "You're just the romantic age," she
continued—"fifty. Twenty-five is too wordly-wise; thirty is apt to
be pale from overwork; forty is the age of long stories that take a
whole cigar to tell; sixty is—oh, sixty is too near seventy; but
fifty is the mellow age. I love fifty."</p>
<p>Fifty seemed to Benjamin a glorious age. He longed passionately
to be fifty.</p>
<p>"I've always said," went on Hildegarde, "that I'd rather marry a
man of fifty and be taken care of than many a man of thirty and
take care of <em>him</em>."</p>
<p>For Benjamin the rest of the evening was bathed in a
honey-coloured mist. Hildegarde gave him two more dances, and they
discovered that they were marvellously in accord on all the
questions of the day. She was to go driving with him on the
following Sunday, and then they would discuss all these questions
further.</p>
<p>Going home in the phaeton just before the crack of dawn, when
the first bees were humming and the fading moon glimmered in the
cool dew, Benjamin knew vaguely that his father was discussing
wholesale hardware.</p>
<p>"… . And what do you think should merit our biggest attention
after hammers and nails?" the elder Button was saying.</p>
<p>"Love," replied Benjamin absent-mindedly.</p>
<p>"Lugs?" exclaimed Roger Button, "Why, I've just covered the
question of lugs."</p>
<p>Benjamin regarded him with dazed eyes just as the eastern sky
was suddenly cracked with light, and an oriole yawned piercingly in
the quickening trees…</p>
