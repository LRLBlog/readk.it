<p>"Good-morning," Mr. Button said, nervously, to the clerk in the
Chesapeake Dry Goods Company. "I want to buy some clothes for my
child."</p>
<p>"How old is your child, sir?"</p>
<p>"About six hours," answered Mr. Button, without due
consideration.</p>
<p>"Babies' supply department in the rear."</p>
<p>"Why, I don't think—I'm not sure that's what I want. It's—he's
an unusually large-size child. Exceptionally—ah—large."</p>
<p>"They have the largest child's sizes."</p>
<p>"Where is the boys' department?" inquired Mr. Button, shifting
his ground desperately. He felt that the clerk must surely scent
his shameful secret.</p>
<p>"Right here."</p>
<p>"Well—" He hesitated. The notion of dressing his son in men's
clothes was repugnant to him. If, say, he could only find
a&#160;<em>very</em>&#160;large boy's suit, he might cut off that
long and awful beard, dye the white hair brown, and thus manage to
conceal the worst, and to retain something of his own
self-respect—not to mention his position in Baltimore society.</p>
<p>But a frantic inspection of the boys' department&#160;revealed
no suits to fit the new-born Button. He blamed the store, of
course—in such cases it is the thing to blame the store.</p>
<p>"How old did you say that boy of yours was?" demanded the clerk
curiously.</p>
<p>"He's—sixteen."</p>
<p>"Oh, I beg your pardon. I thought you said
six&#160;<em>hours</em>. You'll find the youths' department in the
next aisle."</p>
<p>Mr. Button turned miserably away. Then he stopped, brightened,
and pointed his finger toward a dressed dummy in the window
display. "There!" he exclaimed. "I'll take that suit, out there on
the dummy."</p>
<p>The clerk stared. "Why," he protested, "that's not a child's
suit. At least it&#160;<em>is</em>, but it's for fancy dress. You
could wear it yourself!"</p>
<p>"Wrap it up," insisted his customer nervously. "That's what I
want."</p>
<p>The astonished clerk obeyed.</p>
<p>Back at the hospital Mr. Button entered the nursery and almost
threw the package at his son. "Here's your clothes," he snapped
out.</p>
<p>The old man untied the package and viewed the contents with a
quizzical eye.</p>
<p>"They look sort of funny to me," he complained, "I don't want to
be made a monkey of——"</p>
<p>"You've made a monkey of me!" retorted Mr. Button fiercely.
"Never you mind how funny you look. Put them on—or I'll—or
I'll&#160;<em>spank</em>&#160;you." He swallowed uneasily at the
penultimate word, feeling nevertheless that it was the proper thing
to say.</p>
<p>"All right, father"—this with a grotesque simulation of filial
respect—"you've lived longer; you know best. Just as you say."</p>
<p>As before, the sound of the word "father" caused Mr. Button to
start violently.&#160;"And hurry."</p>
<p>"I'm hurrying, father."</p>
<p>When his son was dressed Mr. Button regarded him with
depression. The costume consisted of dotted socks, pink pants, and
a belted blouse with a wide white collar. Over the latter waved the
long whitish beard, drooping almost to the waist. The effect was
not good.</p>
<p>"Wait!"</p>
<p>Mr. Button seized a hospital shears and with three quick snaps
amputated a large section of the beard. But even with this
improvement the ensemble fell far short of perfection. The
remaining brush of scraggly hair, the watery eyes, the ancient
teeth, seemed oddly out of tone with the gayety of the costume. Mr.
Button, however, was obdurate—he held out his hand. "Come along!"
he said sternly.</p>
<p>His son took the hand trustingly. "What are you going to call
me, dad?" he quavered as they walked from the nursery—"just 'baby'
for a while? till you think of a better name?"</p>
<p>Mr. Button grunted. "I don't know," he answered harshly. "I
think we'll call you Methuselah."</p>
