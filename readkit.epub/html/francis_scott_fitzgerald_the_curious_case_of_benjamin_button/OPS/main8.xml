<p>One September day in 1910—a few years after Roger Button &amp;
Co., Wholesale Hardware, had been handed over to young Roscoe
Button—a man, apparently about twenty years old, entered himself as
a freshman at Harvard University in Cambridge. He did not make the
mistake of announcing that he would never see fifty again, nor did
he mention the fact that his son had been graduated from the same
institution ten years before.</p>
<p>He was admitted, and almost immediately attained a prominent
position in the class, partly because he seemed a little older than
the other freshmen, whose average age was about eighteen.</p>
<p>But his success was largely due to the fact that in the football
game with Yale he played so brilliantly, with so much dash and with
such a cold, remorseless anger that he scored seven touchdowns and
fourteen field goals for Harvard, and caused one entire eleven of
Yale men to be carried singly from the field, unconscious. He was
the most celebrated man in college.</p>
<p>Strange to say, in his third or junior year he was scarcely able
to "make" the team. The coaches said that he had lost weight, and
it seemed to the more observant among them that he was not quite as
tall as before. He made no touchdowns—indeed, he was&#160;retained
on the team chiefly in hope that his enormous reputation would
bring terror and disorganisation to the Yale team.</p>
<p>In his senior year he did not make the team at all. He had grown
so slight and frail that one day he was taken by some sophomores
for a freshman, an incident which humiliated him terribly. He
became known as something of a prodigy—a senior who was surely no
more than sixteen—and he was often shocked at the worldliness of
some of his classmates. His studies seemed harder to him—he felt
that they were too advanced. He had heard his classmates speak of
St. Midas', the famous preparatory school, at which so many of them
had prepared for college, and he determined after his graduation to
enter himself at St. Midas', where the sheltered life among boys
his own size would be more congenial to him.</p>
<p>Upon his graduation in 1914 he went home to Baltimore with his
Harvard diploma in his pocket. Hildegarde was now residing in
Italy, so Benjamin went to live with his son, Roscoe. But though he
was welcomed in a general way there was obviously no heartiness in
Roscoe's feeling toward him—there was even perceptible a tendency
on his son's part to think that Benjamin, as he moped about the
house in adolescent mooniness, was somewhat in the way. Roscoe was
married now and prominent in Baltimore life, and he wanted no
scandal to creep out in connection with his family.</p>
<p>Benjamin, no longer persona grata with the débutantes and
younger college set, found himself left much alone, except for the
companionship of three or four fifteen-year-old boys in the
neighborhood. His idea of going to St. Midas school recurred to
him.</p>
<p>"Say," he said to Roscoe one day, "I've told you over and over
that I want to go to prep school."</p>
<p>"Well, go, then," replied Roscoe shortly. The matter was
distasteful to him, and he wished to avoid a discussion.</p>
<p>"I can't go alone," said Benjamin helplessly. "You'll have to
enter me and take me up there."</p>
<p>"I haven't got time," declared Roscoe abruptly. His eyes
narrowed and he looked uneasily at his father. "As a matter of
fact," he added, "you'd better not go on with this business much
longer. You better pull up short. You better—you better"—he paused
and his face crimsoned as he sought for words—"you better turn
right around and start back the other way. This has gone too far to
be a joke. It isn't funny any longer. You—you behave yourself!"</p>
<p>Benjamin looked at him, on the verge of tears.</p>
<p>"And another thing," continued Roscoe, "when visitors are in the
house I want you to call me 'Uncle'—not 'Roscoe,' but 'Uncle,' do
you understand? It looks absurd for a boy of fifteen to call me by
my first name. Perhaps you'd better call me
'Uncle'&#160;<em>all</em>&#160;the time, so you'll get used to
it."</p>
<p>With a harsh look at his father, Roscoe turned away… .</p>
