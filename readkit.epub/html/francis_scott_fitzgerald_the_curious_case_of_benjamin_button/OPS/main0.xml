<p>As long ago as 1860 it was the proper thing to be born at home.
At present, so I am told, the high gods of medicine have decreed
that the first cries of the young shall be uttered upon the
anesthetic air of a hospital, preferably a fashionable one. So
young Mr. and Mrs. Roger Button were fifty years ahead of style
when they decided, one day in the summer of 1860, that their first
baby should be born in a hospital. Whether this anachronism had any
bearing upon the astonishing history I am about to set down will
never be known.</p>
<p>I shall tell you what occurred, and let you judge for
yourself.</p>
<p>The Roger Buttons held an enviable position, both social and
financial, in ante-bellum Baltimore. They were related to the This
Family and the That Family, which, as every Southerner knew,
entitled them to membership in that enormous peerage which largely
populated the Confederacy. This was their first experience with the
charming old custom of having babies—Mr. Button was naturally
nervous. He hoped it would be a boy so that he could be sent to
Yale College in Connecticut, at which institution Mr. Button
himself had been known for four years by the somewhat obvious
nickname of "Cuff."</p>
<p>On the September morning consecrated to the enormous event he
arose nervously at six o'clock, dressed himself, adjusted an
impeccable stock, and hurried forth through the streets of
Baltimore to the hospital, to&#160;determine whether the darkness
of the night had borne in new life upon its bosom.</p>
<p>When he was approximately a hundred yards from the Maryland
Private Hospital for Ladies and Gentlemen he saw Doctor Keene, the
family physician, descending the front steps, rubbing his hands
together with a washing movement—as all doctors are required to do
by the unwritten ethics of their profession.</p>
<p>Mr. Roger Button, the president of Roger Button &amp; Co.,
Wholesale Hardware, began to run toward Doctor Keene with much less
dignity than was expected from a Southern gentleman of that
picturesque period. "Doctor Keene!" he called. "Oh, Doctor
Keene!"</p>
<p>The doctor heard him, faced around, and stood waiting, a curious
expression settling on his harsh, medicinal face as Mr. Button drew
near.</p>
<p>"What happened?" demanded Mr. Button, as he came up in a gasping
rush. "What was it? How is she? A boy? Who is it? What——"</p>
<p>"Talk sense!" said Doctor Keene sharply, He appeared somewhat
irritated.</p>
<p>"Is the child born?" begged Mr. Button.</p>
<p>Doctor Keene frowned. "Why, yes, I suppose so—after a fashion."
Again he threw a curious glance at Mr. Button.</p>
<p>"Is my wife all right?"</p>
<p>"Yes."</p>
<p>"Is it a boy or a girl?"</p>
<p>"Here now!" cried Doctor Keene in a perfect passion of
irritation," I'll ask you to go and see for yourself. Outrageous!"
He snapped the last word out in almost one syllable, then he turned
away muttering: "Do you imagine a case like this will help my
professional reputation? One more would ruin me—ruin anybody."</p>
<p>"What's the matter?" demanded Mr. Button appalled.
"Triplets?"</p>
<p>"No, not triplets!" answered the doctor cuttingly. "What's more,
you can go and see for yourself. And get another doctor. I brought
you into the world, young man, and I've been physician to your
family for forty years, but I'm through with you! I don't want to
see you or any of your relatives ever again! Good-by!"</p>
<p>Then he turned sharply, and without another word climbed into
his phaeton, which was waiting at the curbstone, and drove severely
away.</p>
<p>Mr. Button stood there upon the sidewalk, stupefied and
trembling from head to foot. What horrible mishap had occurred? He
had suddenly lost all desire to go into the Maryland Private
Hospital for Ladies and Gentlemen—it was with the greatest
difficulty that, a moment later, he forced himself to mount the
steps and enter the front door.</p>
<p>A nurse was sitting behind a desk in the opaque gloom of the
hall. Swallowing his shame, Mr. Button approached her.</p>
<p>"Good-morning," she remarked, looking up at him pleasantly.</p>
<p>"Good-morning. I—I am Mr. Button."</p>
<p>At this a look of utter terror spread itself over the girl's
face. She rose to her feet and seemed about to fly from the hall,
restraining herself only with the most apparent difficulty.</p>
<p>"I want to see my child," said Mr. Button.</p>
<p>The nurse gave a little scream. "Oh—of course!" she cried
hysterically. "Up-stairs. Right up-stairs. Go—<em>up!</em>"</p>
<p>She pointed the direction, and Mr. Button, bathed in a cool
perspiration, turned falteringly, and began to mount to the second
floor. In the upper hall he&#160;addressed another nurse who
approached him, basin in hand. "I'm Mr. Button," he managed to
articulate. "I want to see my——"</p>
<p>Clank! The basin clattered to the floor and rolled in the
direction of the stairs. Clank! Clank! It began a methodical
descent as if sharing in the general terror which this gentleman
provoked.</p>
<p>"I want to see my child!" Mr. Button almost shrieked. He was on
the verge of collapse.</p>
<p>Clank! The basin had reached the first floor. The nurse regained
control of herself, and threw Mr. Button a look of hearty
contempt.</p>
<p>"All&#160;<em>right</em>, Mr. Button," she agreed in a hushed
voice. "Very&#160;<em>well!</em>&#160;But if
you&#160;<em>knew</em>&#160;what a state it's put us all in this
morning! It's perfectly outrageous! The hospital will never have
the ghost of a reputation after——"</p>
<p>"Hurry!" he cried hoarsely. "I can't stand this!"</p>
<p>"Come this way, then, Mr. Button."</p>
<p>He dragged himself after her. At the end of a long hall they
reached a room from which proceeded a variety of howls—indeed, a
room which, in later parlance, would have been known as the
"crying-room." They entered. Ranged around the walls were half a
dozen white-enameled rolling cribs, each with a tag tied at the
head.</p>
<p>"Well," gasped Mr. Button, "which is mine?"</p>
<p>"There!" said the nurse.</p>
<p>Mr. Button's eyes followed her pointing finger, and this is what
he saw. Wrapped in a voluminous white blanket, and partly crammed
into one of the cribs, there sat an old man apparently about
seventy years of age. His sparse hair was almost white, and from
his chin dripped a long smoke-coloured beard, which waved absurdly
back and forth, fanned by the breeze coming in at the window. He
looked up at Mr. Button with dim, faded eyes in which lurked a
puzzled question.</p>
<p>"Am I mad?" thundered Mr. Button, his terror resolving into
rage. "Is this some ghastly hospital joke?</p>
<p>"It doesn't seem like a joke to us," replied the nurse severely.
"And I don't know whether you're mad or not—but that is most
certainly your child."</p>
<p>The cool perspiration redoubled on Mr. Button's forehead. He
closed his eyes, and then, opening them, looked again. There was no
mistake—he was gazing at a man of threescore and
ten—a&#160;<em>baby</em>&#160;of threescore and ten, a baby whose
feet hung over the sides of the crib in which it was reposing.</p>
<p>The old man looked placidly from one to the other for a moment,
and then suddenly spoke in a cracked and ancient voice. "Are you my
father?" he demanded.</p>
<p>Mr. Button and the nurse started violently.</p>
<p>"Because if you are," went on the old man querulously, "I wish
you'd get me out of this place—or, at least, get them to put a
comfortable rocker in here,"</p>
<p>"Where in God's name did you come from? Who are you?" burst out
Mr. Button frantically.</p>
<p>"I can't tell you&#160;<em>exactly</em>&#160;who I am," replied
the querulous whine, "because I've only been born a few hours—but
my last name is certainly Button."</p>
<p>"You lie! You're an impostor!"</p>
<p>The old man turned wearily to the nurse. "Nice way to welcome a
new-born child," he complained in a weak voice. "Tell him he's
wrong, why don't you?"</p>
<p>"You're wrong. Mr. Button," said the nurse severely. "This is
your child, and you'll have to make the best of it. We're going to
ask you to take him home with you as soon as possible—some time
to-day."</p>
<p>"Home?" repeated Mr. Button incredulously.</p>
<p>"Yes, we can't have him here. We really can't, you know?"</p>
<p>"I'm right glad of it," whined the old man. "This is&#160;a fine
place to keep a youngster of quiet tastes. With all this yelling
and howling, I haven't been able to get a wink of sleep. I asked
for something to eat"—here his voice rose to a shrill note of
protest—"and they brought me a bottle of milk!"</p>
<p>Mr. Button sank down upon a chair near his son and concealed his
face in his hands. "My heavens!" he murmured, in an ecstasy of
horror. "What will people say? What must I do?"</p>
<p>"You'll have to take him home," insisted the
nurse—"immediately!"</p>
<p>A grotesque picture formed itself with dreadful clarity before
the eyes of the tortured man—a picture of himself walking through
the crowded streets of the city with this appalling apparition
stalking by his side. "I can't. I can't," he moaned.</p>
<p>People would stop to speak to him, and what was he going to say?
He would have to introduce this—this septuagenarian: "This is my
son, born early this morning." And then the old man would gather
his blanket around him and they would plod on, past the bustling
stores, the slave market—for a dark instant Mr. Button wished
passionately that his son was black—past the luxurious houses of
the residential district, past the home for the aged… .</p>
<p>"Come! Pull yourself together," commanded the nurse.</p>
<p>"See here," the old man announced suddenly, "if you think I'm
going to walk home in this blanket, you're entirely mistaken."</p>
<p>"Babies always have blankets."</p>
<p>With a malicious crackle the old man held up a small white
swaddling garment. "Look!" he quavered. "<em>This</em>&#160;is what
they had ready for me."</p>
<p>"Babies always wear those," said the nurse primly.</p>
<p>"Well," said the old man, "this baby's not going to wear
anything in about two minutes. This blanket itches. They might at
least have given me a sheet."</p>
<p>"Keep it on! Keep it on!" said Mr. Button hurriedly. He turned
to the nurse. "What'll I do?"</p>
<p>"Go down town and buy your son some clothes."</p>
<p>Mr. Button's son's voice followed him down into the hall: "And a
cane, father. I want to have a cane."</p>
<p>Mr. Button banged the outer door savagely… .</p>
