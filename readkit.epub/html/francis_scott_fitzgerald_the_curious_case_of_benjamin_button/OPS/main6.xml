<p>In one particular, at least, the friends of Hildegarde Moncrief
were mistaken. The wholesale hardware business prospered amazingly.
In the fifteen years between Benjamin Button's marriage in 1880 and
his father's retirement in 1895, the family fortune was doubled—and
this was due largely to the younger member of the firm.</p>
<p>Needless to say, Baltimore eventually received the couple to its
bosom. Even old General Moncrief became reconciled to his
son-in-law when Benjamin gave&#160;him the money to bring out his
"History of the Civil War" in twenty volumes, which had been
refused by nine prominent publishers.</p>
<p>In Benjamin himself fifteen years had wrought many changes. It
seemed to him that the blood flowed with new vigor through his
veins. It began to be a pleasure to rise in the morning, to walk
with an active step along the busy, sunny street, to work
untiringly with his shipments of hammers and his cargoes of nails.
It was in 1890 that he executed his famous business coup: he
brought up the suggestion that&#160;<em>all nails used in nailing
up the boxes in which nails are shipped are the property of the
shippee</em>, a proposal which became a statute, was approved by
Chief Justice Fossile, and saved Roger Button and Company,
Wholesale Hardware, more than&#160;<em>six hundred nails every
year</em>.</p>
<p>In addition, Benjamin discovered that he was becoming more and
more attracted by the gay side of life. It was typical of his
growing enthusiasm for pleasure that he was the first man in the
city of Baltimore to own and run an automobile. Meeting him on the
street, his contemporaries would stare enviously at the picture he
made of health and vitality.</p>
<p>"He seems to grow younger every year," they would remark. And if
old Roger Button, now sixty-five years old, had failed at first to
give a proper welcome to his son he atoned at last by bestowing on
him what amounted to adulation.</p>
<p>And here we come to an unpleasant subject which it will be well
to pass over as quickly as possible. There was only one thing that
worried Benjamin Button; his wife had ceased to attract him.</p>
<p>At that time Hildegarde was a woman of thirty-five, with a son,
Roscoe, fourteen years old. In the early days of their marriage
Benjamin had worshipped her.&#160;But, as the years passed, her
honey-colored hair became an unexciting brown, the blue enamel of
her eyes assumed the aspect of cheap crockery—moreover, and, most
of all, she had become too settled in her ways, too placid, too
content, too anemic in her excitements, and too sober in her taste.
As a bride it had been she who had "dragged" Benjamin to dances and
dinners—now conditions were reversed. She went out socially with
him, but without enthusiasm, devoured already by that eternal
inertia which comes to live with each of us one day and stays with
us to the end.</p>
<p>Benjamin's discontent waxed stronger. At the outbreak of the
Spanish-American War in 1898 his home had for him so little charm
that he decided to join the army. With his business influence he
obtained a commission as captain, and proved so adaptable to the
work that he was made a major, and finally a lieutenant-colonel
just in time to participate in the celebrated charge up San Juan
Hill. He was slightly wounded, and received a medal.</p>
<p>Benjamin had become so attached to the activity and excitement
of army life that he regretted to give it up, but his business
required attention, so he resigned his commission and came home. He
was met at the station by a brass band and escorted to his
house.</p>
