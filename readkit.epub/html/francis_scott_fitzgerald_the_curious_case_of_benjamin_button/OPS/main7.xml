<p>Hildegarde, waving a large silk flag, greeted him on the porch,
and even as he kissed her he felt with a sinking of the heart that
these three years had taken their toll. She was a woman of forty
now, with a faint skirmish line of gray hairs in her head. The
sight depressed him.</p>
<p>Up in his room he saw his reflection in the
familiar&#160;mirror—he went closer and examined his own face with
anxiety, comparing it after a moment with a photograph of himself
in uniform taken just before the war.</p>
<p>"Good Lord!" he said aloud. The process was continuing. There
was no doubt of it—he looked now like a man of thirty. Instead of
being delighted, he was uneasy—he was growing younger. He had
hitherto hoped that once he reached a bodily age equivalent to his
age in years, the grotesque phenomenon which had marked his birth
would cease to function. He shuddered. His destiny seemed to him
awful, incredible.</p>
<p>When he came downstairs Hildegarde was waiting for him. She
appeared annoyed, and he wondered if she had at last discovered
that there was something amiss. It was with an effort to relieve
the tension between them that he broached the matter at dinner in
what he considered a delicate way.</p>
<p>"Well," he remarked lightly, "everybody says I look younger than
ever."</p>
<p>Hildegarde regarded him with scorn. She sniffed. "Do you think
it's anything to boast about?"</p>
<p>"I'm not boasting," he asserted uncomfortably.</p>
<p>She sniffed again. "The idea," she said, and after a moment: "I
should think you'd have enough pride to stop it."</p>
<p>"How can I?" he demanded.</p>
<p>"I'm not going to argue with you," she retorted. "But there's a
right way of doing things and a wrong way. If you've made up your
mind to be different from everybody else, I don't suppose I can
stop you, but I really don't think it's very considerate."</p>
<p>"But, Hildegarde, I can't help it."</p>
<p>"You can too. You're simply stubborn. You think you don't want
to be like any one else. You always have been that way, and you
always will be. But just think&#160;how it would be if every one
else looked at things as you do—what would the world be like?"</p>
<p>As this was an inane and unanswerable argument Benjamin made no
reply, and from that time on a chasm began to widen between them.
He wondered what possible fascination she had ever exercised over
him.</p>
<p>To add to the breach, he found, as the new century gathered
headway, that his thirst for gayety grew stronger. Never a party of
any kind in the city of Baltimore but he was there, dancing with
the prettiest of the young married women, chatting with the most
popular of the debutantes, and finding their company charming,
while his wife, a dowager of evil omen, sat among the chaperons,
now in haughty disapproval, and now following him with solemn,
puzzled, and reproachful eyes.</p>
<p>"Look!" people would remark. "What a pity! A young fellow that
age tied to a woman of forty-five. He must be twenty years younger
than his wife." They had forgotten—as people inevitably forget—that
back in 1880 their mammas and papas had also remarked about this
same ill-matched pair.</p>
<p>Benjamin's growing unhappiness at home was compensated for by
his many new interests. He took up golf and made a great success of
it. He went in for dancing: in 1906 he was an expert at "The
Boston," and in 1908 he was considered proficient at the "Maxixe,"
while in 1909 his "Castle Walk" was the envy of every young man in
town.</p>
<p>His social activities, of course, interfered to some extent with
his business, but then he had worked hard at wholesale hardware for
twenty-five years and felt that he could soon hand it on to his
son, Roscoe, who had recently graduated from Harvard.</p>
<p>He and his son were, in fact, often mistaken for
each&#160;other. This pleased Benjamin—he soon forgot the insidious
fear which had come over him on his return from the
Spanish-American War, and grew to take a naïve pleasure in his
appearance. There was only one fly in the delicious ointment—he
hated to appear in public with his wife. Hildegarde was almost
fifty, and the sight of her made him feel absurd… .</p>
