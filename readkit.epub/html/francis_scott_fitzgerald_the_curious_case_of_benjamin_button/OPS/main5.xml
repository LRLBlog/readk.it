<p>When, six months later, the engagement of Miss Hildegarde
Moncrief to Mr. Benjamin Button was made known (I say "made known,"
for General Moncrief declared he would rather fall upon his sword
than announce it), the excitement in Baltimore society reached a

Hildegarde refused stubbornly to believe even the true one. In vain
General Moncrief pointed out to her the high mortality among men of
fifty—or, at least, among men who looked fifty; in vain he told her
of the instability of the wholesale hardware business. Hildegarde
had chosen to marry for mellowness, and marry she did… .</p>
