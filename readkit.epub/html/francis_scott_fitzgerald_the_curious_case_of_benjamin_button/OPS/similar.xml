<a href="http://generation.feedbooks.com/book/3622.epub"><em>The
Kama Sutra</em></a>
<p>The Kama Sutra, is an ancient Indian text widely considered to
be the standard work on human sexual behavior in Sanskrit
literature written by the Indian scholar Vatsyayana. A portion of
the work consists of practical advice on sex. Kāma means sensual or
sexual pleasure, and sūtra are the guidlines of yoga, the word
itself means thread in Sanskrit.<br />
The Kama Sutra is the oldest and most notable of a group of texts
known generically as Kama Shastra). Traditionally, the first
transmission of Kama Shastra or "Discipline of Kama" is attributed
to Nandi the sacred bull, Shiva's doorkeeper, who was moved to
sacred utterance by overhearing the lovemaking of the god and his
wife Parvati and later recorded his utterances for the benefit of
mankind.</p>

Adventures in Wonderland</em></a>
<p>Alice's Adventures in Wonderland (1865) is a novel written by
English author Charles Lutwidge Dodgson, better known under the
pseudonym Lewis Carroll. It tells the story of a girl named Alice
who falls down a rabbit-hole into a fantasy world populated by
peculiar and anthropomorphic creatures.<br />
The tale is filled with allusions to Dodgson's friends (and
enemies), and to the lessons that British schoolchildren were
expected to memorize. The tale plays with logic in ways that have
made the story of lasting popularity with adults as well as
children. It is considered to be one of the most characteristic
examples of the genre of literary nonsense, and its narrative
course and structure has been enormously influential, mainly in the
fantasy genre.</p>

of the Worlds</em></a>
<p>The War of the Worlds (1898), by H. G. Wells, is an early
science fiction novel which describes an invasion of England by
aliens from Mars. It is one of the earliest and best-known
depictions of an alien invasion of Earth, and has influenced many
others, as well as spawning several films, radio dramas, comic book
adaptations, and a television series based on the story. The 1938
radio broadcast caused public outcry against the episode, as many
listeners believed that an actual Martian invasion was in progress,
a notable example of mass hysteria.</p>

<p>Dracula is an 1897 novel by Irish author Bram Stoker, featuring
as its primary antagonist the vampire Count Dracula.<br />
Dracula has been attributed to many literary genres including
vampire literature, horror fiction, the gothic novel and invasion
literature. Structurally it is an epistolary novel, that is, told
as a series of diary entries and letters. Literary critics have
examined many themes in the novel, such as the role of women in
Victorian culture, conventional and conservative sexuality,
immigration, colonialism, postcolonialism and folklore. Although
Stoker did not invent the vampire, the novel's influence on the
popularity of vampires has been singularly responsible for many
theatrical and film interpretations throughout the 20th and 21st
centuries.</p>

of War</em></a>
<p>The Art of War is a Chinese military treatise that was written
during the 6th century BC by Sun Tzu. Composed of 13 chapters, each
of which is devoted to one aspect of warfare, it has long been
praised as the definitive work on military strategies and tactics
of its time.<br />
The Art of War is one of the oldest books on military strategy in
the world. It is the first and one of the most successful works on
strategy and has had a huge influence on Eastern and Western
military thinking, business tactics, and beyond. Sun Tzu was the
first to recognize the importance of positioning in strategy and
that position is affected both by objective conditions in the
physical environment and the subjective opinions of competitive
actors in that environment. He taught that strategy was not
planning in the sense of working through a to-do list, but rather
that it requires quick and appropriate responses to changing
conditions. Planning works in a controlled environment, but in a
competitive environment,</p>

and Prejudice</em></a>
<p>Pride And Prejudice, the story of Mrs. Bennet's attempts to
marry off her five daughters is one of the best-loved and most
enduring classics in English literature. Excitement fizzes through
the Bennet household at Longbourn in Hertfordshire when young,
eligible Mr. Charles Bingley rents the fine house nearby. He may
have sisters, but he also has male friends, and one of these—the
haughty, and even wealthier, Mr. Fitzwilliam Darcy—irks the
vivacious Elizabeth Bennet, the second of the Bennet girls. She
annoys him. Which is how we know they must one day marry. The
romantic clash between the opinionated Elizabeth and Darcy is a
splendid rendition of civilized sparring. As the characters dance a
delicate quadrille of flirtation and intrigue, Jane Austen's
radiantly caustic wit and keen observation sparkle.</p>
