<p>In 1920 Roscoe Button's first child was born. During the
attendant festivities, however, no one thought it "the thing" to
mention, that the little grubby boy, apparently about ten years of
age who played around the house with lead soldiers and a miniature
circus, was the new baby's own grandfather.</p>
<p>No one disliked the little boy whose fresh, cheerful face was
crossed with just a hint of sadness, but to Roscoe Button his
presence was a source of torment. In the idiom of his generation
Roscoe did not consider the matter "efficient." It seemed to him
that his father, in refusing to look sixty, had not behaved like a
"red-blooded he-man"—this was Roscoe's favorite expression—but in a
curious and perverse manner. Indeed, to think about the matter for
as much as a half an hour drove him to the edge of insanity. Roscoe
believed that "live wires" should keep young, but carrying it out
on&#160;such a scale was—was—was inefficient. And there Roscoe
rested.</p>
<p>Five years later Roscoe's little boy had grown old enough to
play childish games with little Benjamin under the supervision of
the same nurse. Roscoe took them both to kindergarten on the same
day, and Benjamin found that playing with little strips of colored
paper, making mats and chains and curious and beautiful designs,
was the most fascinating game in the world. Once he was bad and had
to stand in the corner—then he cried—but for the most part there
were gay hours in the cheerful room, with the sunlight coming in
the windows and Miss Bailey's kind hand resting for a moment now
and then in his tousled hair.</p>
<p>Roscoe's son moved up into the first grade after a year, but
Benjamin stayed on in the kindergarten. He was very happy.
Sometimes when other tots talked about what they would do when they
grew up a shadow would cross his little face as if in a dim,
childish way he realized that those were things in which he was
never to share.</p>
<p>The days flowed on in monotonous content. He went back a third
year to the kindergarten, but he was too little now to understand
what the bright shining strips of paper were for. He cried because
the other boys were bigger than he, and he was afraid of them. The
teacher talked to him, but though he tried to understand he could
not understand at all.</p>
<p>He was taken from the kindergarten. His nurse, Nana, in her
starched gingham dress, became the centre of his tiny world. On
bright days they walked in the park; Nana would point at a great
gray monster and say "elephant," and Benjamin would say it after
her, and when he was being undressed for bed that night he would
say it over and over aloud to her: "Elyphant,&#160;elyphant,
elyphant." Sometimes Nana let him jump on the bed, which was fun,
because if you sat down exactly right it would bounce you up on
your feet again, and if you said "Ah" for a long time while you
jumped you got a very pleasing broken vocal effect.</p>
<p>He loved to take a big cane from the hatrack and go around
hitting chairs and tables with it and saying: "Fight, fight,
fight." When there were people there the old ladies would cluck at
him, which interested him, and the young ladies would try to kiss
him, which he submitted to with mild boredom. And when the long day
was done at five o'clock he would go up-stairs with Nana and be fed
oatmeal and nice soft mushy foods with a spoon.</p>
<p>There were no troublesome memories in his childish sleep; no
token came to him of his brave days at college, of the glittering
years when he flustered the hearts of many girls. There were only
the white, safe walls of his crib and Nana and a man who came to
see him sometimes, and a great big orange ball that Nana pointed at
just before his twilight bed hour and called "sun." When the sun
went his eyes were sleepy—there were no dreams, no dreams to haunt
him.</p>
<p>The past—the wild charge at the head of his men up San Juan
Hill; the first years of his marriage when he worked late into the
summer dusk down in the busy city for young Hildegarde whom he
loved; the days before that when he sat smoking far into the night
in the gloomy old Button house on Monroe Street with his
grandfather—all these had faded like unsubstantial dreams from his
mind as though they had never been.</p>
<p>He did not remember. He did not remember clearly whether the
milk was warm or cool at his last feeding or how the days
passed—there was only his crib and Nana's familiar presence. And
then he remembered nothing.&#160;When he was hungry he cried—that
was all. Through the noons and nights he breathed and over him
there were soft mumblings and murmurings that he scarcely heard,
and faintly differentiated smells, and light and darkness.</p>
<p>Then it was all dark, and his white crib and the dim faces that
moved above him, and the warm sweet aroma of the milk, faded out
altogether from his mind.</p>
