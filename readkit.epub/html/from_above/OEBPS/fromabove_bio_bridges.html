				<h4>United States, b. 1948</h4>

			<div>
				<p>Marilyn Bridges is an American photographer known for her fine art black-and-white aerial images of ancient sites and contemporary landscapes. She has worked in over 20 countries on five continents. In 1976, she took her first aerial photographs, of the prehistoric Nazca Lines in Peru. She then enrolled in the Rochester Institute of Technology to study photography, earning a Master of Fine Arts. Her photographs of Nazca were featured in a solo exhibition at the American Museum of Natural History in New York. In 1982 she used a Guggenheim Fellowship to hire a pilot and single engine plane to fly from upstate New York to the Yucat&#225;n, where she photographed ancient Mayan ruins in the jungle. In the 1980s she photographed prehistoric Native American sites, and megalithic monuments in Britain and Brittany. Her first book, <em>Markings: Sacred Landscapes from the Air</em>, was published in 1986. Two years later she used a Fulbright Scholarship in Peru to photograph Machu Picchu and other Inca sites. In 1993 she obtained unprecedented permission to fly over and photograph dozens of ancient Egyptian sites along the Nile. The results appeared in her book <em>Egypt: Antiquities from Above</em>. Her photographs of the United States are featured in her 1997 book <em>This Land is Your Land: Across America by Air</em>. In the last decade, Bridges has worked on major projects to photograph Classical ruins in Greece and Turkey, and Minoan sites in Crete. Bridges has a pilot&#8217;s license, although she flies with a co-pilot in order to concentrate on photographing through an open door. She has published eight books of her aerial work, and is a Fellow of the Explorers Club.</p>
