				<p>The collection at the Center for Creative Photography has an excellent representation of American aerial photography, made throughout the twentieth century and into the twenty-first. To understand the origins of airborne photographs it is necessary to look to Europe. French photographer Gaspard-F&#233;lix Tournachon (known as Nadar, 1820&#8211;1910) made the first successful aerial photographic image in 1858, from a balloon tethered over the village of Petit-Bic&#234;tre outside Paris, thus mechanizing the popular impulse to present cities from a &#8220;bird&#8217;s eye view.&#8221; In these early years of technical innovation, aerial photography was fueled by an interest in mapping, especially for use in military reconnaissance: in the United States, in 1862, the Union Army used a balloon to observe Confederate troop positions during the Civil War, but Southern soldiers quickly realized that the balloons were vulnerable to a sharp-shooter&#8217;s aim, and no extant photographs verify that photography was part of these reconnaissance missions. Kites were an alternative to balloons, such as the twelve-kite system used by Chicago-based photographer, George Lawrence, to capture the devastation wrought by fire following the 1906 San Francisco earthquake. The aerial perspective allowed Lawrence to demonstrate the scope of the event, resulting in photographs that were reproduced in newspapers around the world. Scientists such as Bavarian mathematician and geodetist, Sebastian Finsterwalder, also appreciated the value of the new aerial perspective for collecting data. He started a project in 1888 to make balloon photographs to track the movements and changes in size of Swiss glaciers. In the Center&#8217;s collection, we see all of these uses of aerial photography&#8212;<a href="fromabove_section03_survey.html">military reconnaissance</a>, <a href="fromabove_section02_journalism.html">photojournalism</a>, <a href="fromabove_section01_science.html">scientific exploration</a>&#8212;and, of course, the creation of <a href="fromabove_section04_art.html">art works</a>.</p>
				<p>A study of aerial photography requires an understanding of its unique language. In 2013, we live in an age of ubiquitous photography, and with the omnipresence of photography comes the omnipresence of the photographic language. Photography, speaking more broadly, has its own unique language, which includes a range of visual characteristics, including foreshortening (things closer to the camera look bigger than things further away); the &#8220;freezing&#8221; of action with a quick shutter speed; the blur of motion during a long exposure; and the way a harsh flash affects a space (makes things near the camera bright and over-exposed, leaving background details in shadow), to name a few. These characteristics of the photographic language are becoming increasingly familiar and we accept them without consciously identifying them as specific to photography.</p>
				<p>Aerial photography, however, has its own language, which is less familiar. Aerial photographs tend to be more abstract than ground-based pictures, as they are made from an atypical perspective and have a scale that is often hard to judge. Aerial pictures may not show the horizon, thwarting an expectation of how a &#8220;picture&#8221; of the land is typically organized, with a foreground, middle ground, and distant horizon. The elevated vantage point also allows aerial pictures to encompass a vast and unexpected scope. Aerial pictures can be seen to have a code language, in which objects do not appear as expected, but can be deciphered using visual clues&#8212;for instance, a tree photographed from directly overhead may appear only as a spot, but the shadow of the tree may help reveal its identity.</p>
				<p>The abstraction in aerial photographs has a powerful impact on their legibility, and some photographers use aerial perspective to heighten their subject&#8217;s abstraction. A vertical perspective, one in which the camera is pointing straight down at the earth, can produce pictures that are more cartographic (or map-like) which, due to the dramatic angle, can increase abstraction. An oblique view, one made with the camera pointing at the land at an angle less than 90 degrees, can also abstract the landscape, compressing information into startling arrangements. Photographers use light as a compositional element, selecting direct and overhead illumination to decrease contrast and potentially increase abstraction, or choosing early- or late-day sunlight, with long shadows, to heighten the visual impact of distinctions in the earth&#8217;s surface.</p>
				<p>This aerial photographic language, or aerial vision, can present a puzzle to a viewer. Thus, photographs made from the air create tension between the abstracted view and a viewer&#8217;s desire to &#8220;crack the code&#8221; and understand what they are looking at. William Fox and Dennis Cosgrove, in their book <em>Photography and Flight</em>, thoroughly establish that aerial vision is intrinsic to humankind, not something we learn through exposure to an aerial perspective. Our innate ability to conceive an imagined view from above causes us to engage with aerial photographs with vigor, drawn in by the challenge of connecting with an unfamiliar perspective.</p>
				<p>Aerial photography plays on another relationship&#8212;that between the visual experience of the world and one that is more physical. While aerial photographs suggest an intellectual process of surveying the land, collecting information and creating a visual command of a space&#8212;all of which has an objective neutrality&#8212;there is a parallel suggestion of an actual plane moving over the land that is photographed. Aerial photographs can conjure the process and physicality of a camera moving through space, along with a related set of questions. How does an aerial camera work? Does someone press the shutter release or does it happen automatically? How fast are the planes moving and at what altitude? When pilots are doing military reconnaissance, are they in danger of being shot at? Is there always risk when making aerial photographs?</p>
				<p>These characteristics&#8212;the unique qualities of aerial vision, the presence of abstraction, the impact of light, and the dynamic tension between visual and physical experience suggested by the aerial perspective&#8212;all combine to create photographs that are intellectually compelling and engaging. In addition, they can be enjoyed for their intrinsically visual appeal as photographic works of art. Despite some similarities among aerial photographs, photographers have worked in different styles to engage the medium to achieve different ends.</p>
				<p><em>From Above</em> includes around 80 works from the Center&#8217;s Collection, along with several loans from artists. The exhibition explores the variety of reasons photographers have taken to the air. Even though all these photographs have strong visual appeal, and can be appreciated as photographic works of art, the prints are grouped according to the intention of their original maker. To underscore the diversity of aerial photography&#8217;s applications, we have invited specialists from a variety of fields (graphic design, cartography, architecture, land management) to respond to the photographs from their particular point of view. These specialists&#8217; words and perspectives appear with the images, encouraging alternate ways of seeing the work.</p>
