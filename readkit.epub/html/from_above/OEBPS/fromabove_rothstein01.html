				<p>With hurricanes Sandy and Katrina still part of the national conscience, this Depression era flood seems very current. The standard, modest farmstead is still in place, including partially submerged cars, while a boat is moored in front of the farmhouse door, perhaps recording a recovery of the occupants from this national disaster: the Dust Bowl and the Great Mississippi River Flood. I wonder whether this date is accurate because the great flood of the Ohio and Mississippi Rivers occurred in 1937, I believe, not 1938, although flooding of Mississippi had been a persistent problem until the Army Corps of Engineers conquered some of these issues. Ironically today, the problem with the Mississippi River is its low level, making commerce slower and more difficult. &#8212;<a href="fromabove_bio_morgan.html">Keith Morgan, <em>Architectural Historian</em></a></p>
				<p>Animals know where to build their nests or burrows, and when resources diminish and survival depends on it, they relocate. Our notion of home is layered with so many cultural and familial memories that keep us tethered to a place&#8212;in spite of recurring natural and manmade disasters, or political and religious conflict. I think of Dorothy's famous words after her post-tornado adventure, &#8220;there&#8217;s no place like home&#8221;. &#8212;<a href="fromabove_bio_rosano.html">Teresa Rosano, <em>Architect</em></a></p>
