				<p>Morgan Loew is an investigative reporter at CBS 5 News in Phoenix. Over the course of 20 years, his assignments have taken him around the globe. Highlights include covering the United States Supreme Court, tracking down a fugitive pedophile priest in Europe and working as a war correspondent during the invasion of Iraq.</p> 
				<p>Closer to home, Morgan covered the drug war in Mexico, including numerous undercover assignments in that country. He spent six weeks undercover with white supremacists on the Arizona side of the border. The resulting report exposed how volatile the group was and foreshadowed how violent its members would become. Two of them went on to murder a total of six people, including three children.</p> 
				<p>Morgan&#8217;s work has been recognized with numerous journalism awards, including eight Emmys and the prestigious Edward R. Murrow Award for investigative reporting. He is on the faculty of the University of Phoenix, where he teaches political science, is an adjunct professor at Arizona State University&#8217;s Walter Cronkite School of Journalism, and is the president of the Arizona First Amendment Coalition.</p> 
				<p>Morgan graduated from the University of Arizona Journalism School with an emphasis on photojournalism and is a graduate of Concord Law School.</p>
