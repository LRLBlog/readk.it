				<p>This is not only a powerful abstract image but the fractal patterns really jump out at me. There is not only the strong fractal patterns at the bottom, at what I take to be a river mouth, but there are much more delicate patterns in upper left where you&#8217;re looking at what I think are salt deposits at the side of a flow, where the water flowed out and evaporated. There must be something fundamental about repeating fractal patterns that resonates with human beings because we&#8217;re just as thrilled by looking at a really well-developed tree branching out as we are at looking at a river from above. &#8212;<a href="fromabove_bio_strom.html">Stephen Strom, <em>Astronomer</em></a></p>
