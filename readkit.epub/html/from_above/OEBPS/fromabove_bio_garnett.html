				<p>William Garnett was born in Chicago, Illinois, but grew up in Pasadena, California. After high school, he studied one year at Los Angeles’ Art Center School and then, beginning in 1938, worked as a graphic designer and independent commercial photographer doing product advertising, portraiture and architectural views. In 1940, Garnett became the Pasadena Police Department photographer in charge of crime scene documentation. In 1944, drafted by the U.S. Army, Garnett trained as a motion picture cameraman for the Signal Corps. After leaving the Army in 1945, Garnett pursued a career in aerial photography. He cited the cross-country transport flight home, during which he was impressed by the beauty and grandeur visible from the navigator’s seat, as his inspiration. Garnett used the G.I. Bill to pay for flight instruction and by 1947 had purchased his first plane. In 1950, the Lakewood Park Corp hired Garnett to document the “instant city” they were building near Long Beach, with 500 houses constructed per week, and a total of 17,500 within 3 years. Garnett’s photographs emphasized the efficiency and regularity of the housing development, characteristics that reflected Lakewood’s success; over time, however, critics saw in Garnett’s pictures evidence of the ills of mass development. Their subsequent prominent use to symbolize development at the cost of natural habitat, earned Garnett exhibitions and photojournalism assignments. In 1953, he was awarded the first of three Guggenheim fellowships and in 1955, bought a Cessna 170B which, with small modifications, he used for decades for his photography. In 1968 he joined the College of Environmental Design at the University of California, Berkeley, where he served as a professor until his 1984 retirement. With a 1954 portfolio of his “Over California” aerial photographs in <em>Fortune</em> magazine; his inclusion in Edward Steichen’s 1955 Museum of Modern Art <em>Family of Man</em> exhibition; and a solo exhibition at the George Eastman House International Museum of Photography that same year, Garnett was the first aerial photographer to be widely celebrated as an art-maker.</p>
