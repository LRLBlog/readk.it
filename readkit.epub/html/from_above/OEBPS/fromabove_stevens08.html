				<p>This image looks very familiar because my current home is on the Jeffersonian grid in the lower half of this view, facing westward and a tad north. It encompasses much of the East Bay, including Berkeley (lower half) and foothills of Mount Diablo, along with portions of the city of San Francisco (upper left), the Bay (middle), and Marin (upper right). In the distance, further upper right landscape features are the contours of Bolinas Bay, Drake&#8217;s Bay, and Point Reyes moving northward. The vast Pacific Ocean bleeds off the top edge of the field of view. This photograph captures the Bay Area before construction of the Golden Gate Bridge and the (San Francisco-Oakland) Bay Bridge. The most incredible thing about this photograph may be the cloudless and fog free day. Hella East Bay! &#8212;<a href="fromabove_bio_ugarte.html">Eduardo de Ugarte, <em>Graphic Designer</em></a></p>
