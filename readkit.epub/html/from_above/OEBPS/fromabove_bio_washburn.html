				<h2>Bradford Washburn</h2>
				<h4>United States, 1910&#8211;2007</h4>

				<p>Bradford Washburn is known as a mountaineer who made eight first-recorded ascents of North American peaks; a cartographer who authored two dozen maps, including the Grand Canyon, Mount Everest and Mount McKinley; and as a photographer who pioneered high-resolution, large-format aerial pictures. Washburn&#8217;s primary profession was as founding director of the Boston Museum of Science from 1939 to 1980; he transformed it from an outdated natural history museum to a leading science center. With the Museum of Science as his base, Washburn pursued his childhood pastimes of photography and mountain climbing throughout his long life. He was most identified with North America&#8217;s highest mountain, Mount McKinley. At 20,320 feet, it had been considered among the most difficult to climb before Washburn&#8217;s exploration. In 1947, Washburn became the first to reach its summit twice and his wife Barbara became the first woman to achieve the summit. Washburn devised a new path to the McKinley summit known as the West Buttress Route based on a decade of creating detailed maps and shooting hundreds of photographs. Between 1981 and 1984, he coordinated aerial mapping flights over Mount Everest, and though he never climbed the peak, additional research in 1999 determined that Everest is 29,035 feet tall, seven feet higher than previously measured. Washburn made his first aerial photographs in the French Alps in 1927, but began using aerial cameras in Alaska in 1934. He was trained to use a Fairchild K-6 (7&#8221; x 9&#8221;) by Captain Albert W. Stevens, who Washburn called &#8220;the best aerial photographer in the world.&#8221; Washburn&#8217;s photography is characterized by dramatic light just following sunrise or prior to sunset, which transforms his mountain subjects into a three-dimensional relief map. Of his aerial work, Washburn said, &#8220;I wasn&#8217;t taking photographs to make art.... The photographs were indispensable to my geological and mapping research, as well as in my efforts to show the best possible climbing routes for many mountains.&#8221;</p>
