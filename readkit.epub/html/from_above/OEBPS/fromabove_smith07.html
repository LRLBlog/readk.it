				<p>This photo of the Tinian siege is impressive for the photographic bravado it implies. For Smith to have taken this picture, he would had to have been in a companion plane a little above and ahead of the plane that is seen&#8212;and likewise dodging bomb bursts while virtually scraping the ground. I am not sure today&#8217;s war photographers would accept a similar assignment. &#8212;<a href="fromabove_bio_allen.html">Craig Allen, <em>Journalism Professor</em></a></p>
				<p>Virtually every aircraft used during World War II was capable of carrying a camera to provide images for evaluating the effects of an air strike. As a side effect these official cameras and the thousands of unofficial ones carried by soldiers and airmen gave us a massive body of historical documentation of the largest war in human history. &#8212;<a href="fromabove_bio_stemm.html">James Stemm, <em>Curator of Collections, Pima Air &#38; Space Museum</em></a></p>
				<p>Smith&#8217;s image is a classic piece of journalism. It frames smoke, fields, coast and plane in a way that tells me a story. This picture can stand alone, or add a valuable visual element to an article about the battle for Tinian Island. Having shot pictures out of a plane myself, I marvel at the way Smith was able to capture this image in the precise manner he did. &#8220;Easier said than done&#8221; is an extreme understatement here. &#8212;<a href="fromabove_bio_loew.html">Morgan Loew, <em>Investigative Reporter, CBS 5 News, Phoenix</em></a></p>
