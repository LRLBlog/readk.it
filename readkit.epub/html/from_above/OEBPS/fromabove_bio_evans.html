				<h2>Terry Evans</h2>
				<h4>United States, b. 1944</h4>

				<p>Terry Evans, who currently lives in Chicago, was born in Kansas City, Missouri, and spent a good deal of her adult life in Salina, Kansas. About Evans, photographer Alan Thomas has written, &#8220;In the 1980s, the photographer Terry Evans &#8230; shifted her attention from isolated areas of pristine tall grass prairie to the wider inhabited prairie and the complex pressures on its ecology. The unexpected prompt was a photograph of an abandoned atomic test site on a Pacific atoll. Only eight miles from Evans&#8217;s family farm in Salina, Kansas, lay the Smoky Hills Weapons Range. Also nearby were the traces of a prisoner-of-war camp for German soldiers captured during World War II. Evans wanted to see and understand this other prairie&#8212;&#8220;disturbed, cultivated, militarized&#8221;&#8212;and to do so, she realized, she would need to take to the air &#8230; From the vantage of a Cessna, Evans could tell different stories of the prairie&#8212;stories of irrigation and extraction, flooded fields and drained wetlands, feedlots and bomb targets. Seen from the air, these features of the prairie could be shown in truer relation to one another, although in Evans&#8217;s photographs the aerial perspective offers not a panoptical view but a provisional and humble one.&#8221; Evans often combines her aerial photographs with pictures made from the ground, and has focused her lens on the city of Chicago; steel mills in Illinois, Indiana, Ohio and Pennsylvania; and Greenland&#8217;s Jakobshavn Glacier. Recently she completed a twenty-year project about the Kansas town of Matfield Green and the surrounding Flint Hills and is currently photographing the North Dakota oil boom in collaboration with writer Elizabeth Farnsworth. She was a member of the Water in the West collective that came together to create an archive of contemporary photographs that could contribute to an emerging dialogue about the West&#8217;s essential and dwindling resource.</p>
