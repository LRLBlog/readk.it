				<p>Stunning panoramic aerial oblique taken from above the San Francisco Peninsula looking north. The view northeast scans across San Francisco Bay to San Pablo Bay and Carquinez Strait where the Sacramento-San Joaquin Rivers empty into the Bay Area. The large island between the San Francisco Peninsula and the East Bay is Yerba Buena, and today the Bay Bridge connects across that landform. Alcatraz is the smaller white rock island to the west and immediately north of the city of San Francisco.</p>
				<p>On the far horizon to the east are the snow-capped peaks of the Sierra Nevada so this is likely a winter-spring vista. The view northwest across the Golden Gate along the coast to the Marin Peninsula affords a glimpse of the dark ridgeline of the Point Reyes Peninsula and beyond the depression of Tomales Bay, which is the surface trench of the San Andreas Fault.</p>
				<p>This view can be dated as pre-1930s because no bridges are evident&#8212;either the Bay Bridge connecting the San Francisco Peninsula to the East Bay or the Golden Gate that links the same peninsula to Marin. The built up area of the city of San Francisco is visible especially the downtown on the bay side visualized by the relief of high-rise buildings, and on the land side various so-called western additions that stretch all the way to the Pacific. Golden Gate Park is the dark rectangular swath bisecting the western additions.</p>
				<p>South of San Francisco the peninsula is chiefly rural and undeveloped except for a necklace of smaller settlements along the highway (US 101). The large settlement cluster in the lower foreground is likely San Mateo and Palo Alto and other nearby small towns. The distinctive meandering sloughs and estuaries along the south bay-shore is largely filled in and built up today. &#8212;<a href="fromabove_bio_arreola.html">Daniel Arreola, <em>Cultural Geographer</em></a></p>
				<p>A switch in the land and sea temperature difference from day to night results in daily transitions from sea to land breezes. Urbanization changes the thermodynamic properties of the land surface and can influence this air circulation, precipitation patterns, and the movement of pollutants. &#8212;<a href="fromabove_bio_svoma.html">Bo Svoma, <em>Climatologist &#38; Physical Geographer</em></a></p>
