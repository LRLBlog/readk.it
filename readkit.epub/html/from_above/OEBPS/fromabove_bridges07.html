				<p>Ruins and monuments are documents of power on the landscape. In this haunting photograph, a volcano that ruined cities and human lives is a monument to nature’s might. Marilyn Bridges captures the harrowing violence of nature’s battleground and the poetry of her force: she can spew out fire, turn creatures to ash and cover the land in tree shrapnel. &#8212;<a href="fromabove_bio_hernandez.html">Casandra Hernandez, <em>Education &#38; Programs Manager, ASU Deer Valley Rock Art Center</em></a></p>
				<p>A beautiful, artistic image fills the frame. In reality, it is the mass demolition of a mammoth forest—300-foot trees turned to match sticks by volcanic force. This image evokes personal reaction. As a cub TV reporter in the Northwest, I covered the 1980 Mt. St. Helens eruption. I saw this same incredible scene. &#8212;<a href="fromabove_bio_allen.html">Craig Allen, <em>Journalism Professor</em></a></p>
