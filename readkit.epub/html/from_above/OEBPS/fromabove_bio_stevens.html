				<p>Captain Albert W. Stevens was trained as an electrical engineer. In January 1918, Stevens volunteered for the U.S. Army Air Service and trained at the Aeronautics Aerial Photography School at Cornell University, in Ithaca, New York. Stevens&#8217; work in France, between July and November of 1918, as 1st Lieutenant of the 6th Aerial Photographic Section, was as an aerial observer, operating a camera from the rear open cockpit of a biplane; a job that exposed him to enemy anti-aircraft fire. In November 1918, Stevens was appointed Chief Photographic Officer for the U.S. First Army and spent the post-war months photographing cities and battlefields in France and Germany. Upon his return to the United States, Stevens&#8217; aerial work continued under the auspices of the U.S. Army Air Service, and included making an aerial survey of New York City and vicinity (with the aim of making a composite photographic mosaic); testing new Eastman Kodak aerial cameras; conducting an aerial survey of New Hampshire&#8217;s Mount Washington; making what was then the highest altitude parachute jump from 24,200 feet (in June 1922); completing an aerial survey of the Nashville quadrangle for the U.S. Geological Survey; performing an extended aerial survey of the western U.S. in late 1923; and engaging in another survey of the landmarks and National Parks of the Western U.S. for the Department of the Interior in mid-1925. He achieved his greatest national fame for a series of balloon ascents attempting to reach the stratosphere. On November 11, 1935, Stevens, along with Captain Orvil A. Anderson of the Army Air Corps, made a record balloon ascent near Rapid City, South Dakota, watched by 20,000 spectators and with millions following a live radio broadcast, as their sealed balloon gondola Explorer II climbed to 72,395 feet, nearly 14 miles, a record unequaled in Stevens&#8217; lifetime.</p>
