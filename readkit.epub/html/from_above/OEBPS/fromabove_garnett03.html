				<p>First of all it resonates with Edward Weston&#8217;s dune images&#8212;it could be Oceano from above. Then what I notice is the overall pattern, that sinuous line, the molded sand, and then the thing that appeals next are the ripples. To me being able to see the ripples on this scale is something that&#8217;s peculiar to an aerial photograph or a satellite photograph and not only does it add a counter point of delicacy to the strong graphic strokes and sculptural form, but because you have such a long view and you&#8217;re looking at such a broad patch of land you can actually infer the physical forces that have been at work recently on the dune. The streaks illustrate the principle direction of the wind and the ripples&#8212;if you draw a line that more or less follows the ripple you notice that the ripples are perpendicular to the direction you infer for the wind. I can imagine the wind blowing over the top of the dune and I believe it&#8217;s a Kelvin-Helmholtz instability that produces the wave, it&#8217;s a little instability, that produces those wave-like patterns. If you were standing there you could probably see the ripples but you would not see the overall pattern so it allows you to infer nicely what&#8217;s happening and if I had even more data from an even higher vantage point, I would probably be able to tell something even more about the predominant topography and why the dune looks like that. &#8212;<a href="fromabove_bio_strom.html">Stephen Strom, <em>Astronomer</em></a></p>
