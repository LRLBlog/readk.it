				<p>Iconic and singular, but so unlike a modernist's quest to create new contexts and "puncture past beauty". See how it fits into the urban fabric, with attention to detail at top and bottom, meeting the street in a way that respects the public unquestioningly. &#8212;<a href="fromabove_bio_talen.html"><span class="attribution">Emily&#160;Talen</span></a></p>
				<p>Detroit has become so much the example of a failed urban center that it is refreshing to see this image of one of its greatest skyscrapers. Built in 1929, a decade before this image was taken, the Union Trust Building, now known as the Guardian Building, represented proudly the economic and financial might of Americaâ€™s automobile industry. The Art Deco bank with fantastic terracotta ornament remains one of the glories of downtown Detroit. &#8212;<a href="fromabove_bio_morgan.html">Keith Morgan, <em>Architectural Historian</em></a></p>
