				<p>A small footprint of a town in the 1930s, Valdez, Alaska, is situated on Prince William Sound east of Anchorage. The Chugach ice field (out of view and left of the image) is the source of the braided stream system that courses across and around the town toward the sound, which is iced over in this view.  The town is surrounded by levees to protect it from the seasonal outflow of water in these streams. The unmistakable street grid—harkening back to colonial Philadelphia—gives away the cultural heritage of the place as an American settlement. The loneliness and isolation of this spot seen here cannot foretell the pivot point it would become some three decades later as the southern end of the Alaska oil pipeline. &#8212;<a href="fromabove_bio_arreola.html">Daniel Arreola, <em>Cultural Geographer</em></a></p>
				<p>Perfect little gray squares in the wilderness. A town that dead-ends and goes nowhere. And yet, the defiant, unalterable grid stakes a claim in the wilderness, against the forces of nature. &#8212;<a href="fromabove_bio_talen.html"><span class="attribution">Emily&#160;Talen</span></a></p>
