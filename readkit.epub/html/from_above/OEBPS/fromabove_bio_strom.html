				<p>Stephen Strom (Astronomer emeritus, National Optical Astronomy Observatory) has spent his professional career as an astronomer. Born in 1942 in New York City, he graduated from Harvard College in 1962. In 1964 he received his Masters and Ph.D. in Astronomy from Harvard University. From 1964-68 he held appointments as Lecturer in Astronomy at Harvard and Astrophysicist at the Smithsonian Astrophysical Observatory. He then moved to the State University of New York at Stony Brook and served for 4 years as Coordinator of Astronomy and Astrophysics. In 1972 he accepted an appointment at the Kitt Peak National Observatory in Tucson, AZ, where he served as Chair of the Galactic and Extragalactic program. The following 15 years were spent at the University of Massachusetts in Amherst, MA; from 1984-1997 he served as Chairman of the Five College Astronomy Department. In 1998 Strom returned to Tucson as a member of the scientific staff at the National Optical Astronomy Observatory where he carried out research directed at understanding the formation of stars and planetary systems. He retired from NOAO in 2007.</p> 
				<p>Stephen began photographing the landscape in 1978. He studied both the history of photography and silver and non-silver photography in studio courses with Todd Walker at the University of Arizona. His work has been exhibited widely throughout the United States and is held in several permanent collections. A monograph of Stephen's images, <em>Earth Forms</em>, was published in 2009 by Dewi Lewis Publishing. </p>
