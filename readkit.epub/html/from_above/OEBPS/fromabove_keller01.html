				<p>The morphology of a mountain landscape tells us about the past. Sharp ridges and peaks are formed by the awesome force of glacial ice, indicating that this mountain range has been glaciated for hundreds of thousands of years, more extensively at other times than in recent centuries. &#8212;<a href="fromabove_bio_svoma.html">Bo Svoma, <em>Climatologist &#38; Physical Geographer</em></a></p>
				<p>The highest point of the face of the Earth, seen from above. The ability to give us a new, expanded perspective on the world is one of the greatest contributions of aerial photography. It may also have given us a false sense of our superiority over nature. &#8212;<a href="fromabove_bio_stemm.html">James Stemm, <em>Curator of Collections, Pima Air &#38; Space Museum</em></a></p>
