				<h2>A Landmark Photography Partnership</h2>
				<h4></h4>
			</div>
			<div>
				<p>In 2006, Phoenix Art Museum and the Center for Creative Photography at the University of Arizona in Tucson inaugurated a highly innovative and unprecedented collaboration to bring the finest in photography to the Museum’s visitors. It established a vibrant new photography exhibition program at the Museum, while bringing the Center’s world-renowned collections to new and larger audiences.</p>
				<p>The Center is one of the world’s largest repositories of materials chronicling photography. Founded in 1975, it now houses four million archival items and 90,000 fine prints by photographers including Ansel Adams, Edward Weston, Harry Callahan, Aaron Siskind, Frederick Sommer, W. Eugene Smith, Louise Dahl-Wolfe and Garry Winogrand.</p>
				<p>One of the nation’s leading art museums, Phoenix Art Museum presents international exhibitions of the world’s greatest art and features a collection that spans the centuries and the globe—American, Asian, contemporary, European, Latin American and Western American art, and fashion design. Not to be missed are the Thorne Miniature Rooms, the interactive family gallery PhxArtKids, great shopping and dining, and a variety of public events.</p>
				<p>Now, through the combined efforts of these two organizations, the Museum’s visitors experience unparalleled excellence in the field of photography in the Doris and John Norton Gallery for the Center for Creative Photography.</p>
