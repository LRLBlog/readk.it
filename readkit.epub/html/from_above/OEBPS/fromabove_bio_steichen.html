				<h2>Edward Steichen</h2>
				<h4>United States, 1879&#8211;1973</h4>

				<p>Edward Steichen maintained a long and varied career in photography, including working as an avant-garde Pictorialist photographer at the turn of the twentieth century, creating fashion photographs for <em>Vanity Fair</em> and <em>Vogue</em> in the 1920s and 1930s, and curating the famous <em>Family of Man</em> exhibition as photography curator for the Museum of Modern Art in the mid-1950s. He also played a role in military aerial photographic reconnaissance in the First World War. When the United States joined World War I, it found itself totally unprepared for photographic reconnaissance, especially compared with the organized programs of Britain and France. Schools were established at the Eastman Kodak Company in Rochester, New York, and at Cornell University, where students learned to fly reconnaissance planes, take photographs, process and interpret them. Steichen entered active duty as a first lieutenant in the Army Air Service and once the Photographic Section was formed, he chose to work in aerial photography (rather than the ground unit, which did news and publicity photographs). Although there is no evidence that Steichen made aerial photographs during the war, he oversaw the organization and formation of the American aerial photography section. He quoted the number of prints made under his supervision between the beginning of July, 1918 and July, 1919 at 1,300,000. In the first World War, aerial photographers were almost exclusively operating manual cameras, which required releasing the shutter for each exposure, but by the end of the war experiments were being conducted with automated cameras. During World War II, Steichen was ultimately placed in command of all naval combat photography, although he began by overseeing a small unit of photographers to document naval aviation, and by making photographs in the warâ€™s Pacific theater. </p>			</div>
