				<p>Aircraft carriers like this Essex class ship and the Grumman TBM Avenger flying over it changed naval warfare forever during World War II. Control of the sea comes from the air. &#8212;<a href="fromabove_bio_stemm.html">James Stemm, <em>Curator of Collections, Pima Air &#38; Space Museum</em></a></p>
				<p>This is an unforgettable image not only for its capture of plane and mother ship. As the giant carrier recedes, the tiny plane and the lone pilot are what stand out. The reversed perspective is a powerful statement on the solitude of warfare. &#8212;<a href="fromabove_bio_allen.html">Craig Allen, <em>Journalism Professor</em></a></p>
				<p>The goal of every piece of photojournalism is to use an image to tell a story. In a rare instance, the image reveals to its viewer a greater truth about the situation being photographed. This is one of those instances. The placement of the plane, pilotâ€™s head barely visible, the vast ocean below and the largest class of ship at sea, seeming so impossibly small in the distance, combine to illustrate one of the toughest tasks in manned flight: landing a plane on an aircraft carrier. &#8212;<a href="fromabove_bio_loew.html">Morgan Loew, <em>Investigative Reporter, CBS 5 News, Phoenix</em></a></p>
