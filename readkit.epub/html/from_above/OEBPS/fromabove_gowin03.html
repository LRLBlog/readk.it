				<p>I love that this feels primordial, current, and familiar at the same time. It&#8217;s from a point of view that connects us to the patterns of larger forces. Always nice at some elemental level. &#8212;<a href="fromabove_bio_shikany.html">Peter Shikany, <em>Graphic Designer</em></a></p>
				<p>Gowin expresses a lot in a narrow tonal range and it&#8217;s an image that could easily be over dramatized. There are fractal patterns galore in this image&#8212;it&#8217;s just rich with them. Because it&#8217;s an aerial photograph the fractal patterns clearly demonstrate the interplay between the elements and the geology. You can see the water flow even though there&#8217;s not a drop of water flowing at the time. You can see the history of past water flow from the way the foliage is set up and there is information on all scales from the large sculptural elements of the mountain to the fractal patterns of the water paths to the small dots that further outline the water paths and tell a story about what water and earth do together.  &#8212;<a href="fromabove_bio_strom.html">Stephen Strom, <em>Astronomer</em></a></p>
