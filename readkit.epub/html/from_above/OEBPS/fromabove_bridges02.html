				<p>For thousands of years, humans have felt the necessity to carve, sculpt and paint millions of images on the landscape. We were here. This happened here. This has meaning. Glyphs of white horses have marked the hills of England since&#8212;possibly&#8212;the Bronze Age. Why have white horses been powerful symbols in this landscape, for so long, for so many? Marilyn Bridges photograph is melancholy and mysterious, an ethereal human trace on an immortal landscape. Her ghostly Cherhill Horse is still with desire; an 18th century desire to see self and country as a galloping white horse. &#8212;<a href="fromabove_bio_hernandez.html">Casandra Hernandez, <em>Education &#38; Programs Manager, ASU Deer Valley Rock Art Center</em></a></p>
