				<p>San Rafael is located in the North Bay area of San Francisco Bay.  A more modest community of little more than 5,000 residents at the time of this photograph, we can see the main commercial boulevard extended into the distance along the left side of the image. A parallel street to the right holds more public or institutional buildings. The tower of Mission San Rafael Archangel can be seen further to the right, at the head of a cross street corridor with adjacent public buildings, one of which looks like a courthouse. &#8212;<a href="fromabove_bio_morgan.html">Keith Morgan, <em>Architectural Historian</em></a></p>
				<p>This typical street and block plan, mixed-use and multimodal, with multi-story buildings and interspersed green spaces, with its growth constrained by the surrounding topography was historically quite commonplace. Being from the Southwestern U.S., however, makes this &#8220;typical&#8221; plan seem like a novelty. &#8212;<a href="fromabove_bio_rosano.html">Teresa Rosano, <em>Architect</em></a></p>
				<p>San Rafael, a small town nestled against the hills of the Marin Peninsula north of San Francisco. This view captures the main street of the town on the left (multiple story buildings) and the residential zone climbing into the hills on the right of the image. The view affords a good example of how western towns in the Bay Area are cultural landscapes of exotic vegetation because the natural habitat here was likely grasses on hills with some trees in the canyon slopes. Many kinds of trees including pine and fir trees, a range of deciduous and other evergreen trees, even palm trees are discernible in this image. Period automobiles parked on streets give a date stamp to the image&#8212;1920s&#8212;and the abundant sidewalks suggest that San Rafael was a pedestrian place, an enviable environment in today&#8217;s machine space cities. &#8212;<a href="fromabove_bio_arreola.html">Daniel Arreola, <em>Cultural Geographer</em></a></p>
