				<p>Air photo interpreters use a variety of visual clues to identify what they&#8217;re seeing in an aerial image. In the top part of this image, the shapes of bright and shaded areas tell us we&#8217;re seeing mountains. In the lower area, the pattern of bright and shaded areas is far different&#8212;smaller and with sharper shadows&#8212;suggesting sand dunes, interspersed with a little scattered vegetation&#8212;dark dots at the edges of the dunes. &#8212;<a href="fromabove_bio_trapido-lurie.html">Barbara Trapido-Lurie, <em>Cartographer</em></a></p>
				<p>The scale is deceiving here. The wind erosion looks like ripples licked by a spring breeze into a pond or large puddle. This pattern also conjures the appearance of snow drifting in the wind on a cold, blustery Chicago winter day; in stark contrast, this location marks the place of Earth&#8217;s hottest recorded air temperature, and the ripples are desert dunes on a colossal scale. The pattern also resembles the cracked, dried surface of salt flats of Uyuni in the high Andes Mountains of Bolivia during dry season (from April to November), like an array or grid of tiles. &#8212;<a href="fromabove_bio_ugarte.html">Eduardo de Ugarte, <em>Graphic Designer</em></a></p>
