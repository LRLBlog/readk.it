				<h2>W. Eugene Smith</h2>
				<h4>United States, 1918&#8211;1978</h4>

				<p>W. Eugene Smith is best known for his contribution to the photographic essay form, especially as presented in the pages of <em>Life</em> Magazine, with stories like &#8216;Country Doctor&#8217; (20 Sept 1948), &#8216;Spanish Village&#8217; (9 April 1951), &#8216;Nurse Midwife&#8217; (3 Dec 1951), a series on Albert Schweitzer called &#8216;Man of Mercy&#8217; (15 Nov 1954), and his work on the effects of mercury poisoning in Japan, published as &#8216;Minamata&#8217; (2 June 1972). Prior to his position as <em>Life</em> staff photographer, Smith was invited to join Edward Steichen&#8217;s World War II group of photographers recording the Navy&#8217;s airmen, but his poor eyesight and broken eardrum left him unfit for service. The publishing firm Ziff-Davis hired Smith as a naval correspondent in the Pacific theater of the war and, by September 1943, Smith was at sea. In November, after short stints on several carriers, he joined the USS <em>Bunker Hill</em> aircraft carrier, from which he made many flights. Smith was able to have hatches cut in the airplanes&#8217; plexiglas cockpit canopies, so that he could get unobstructed photographs, and often communicated with the pilots about where he wanted to make pictures. In some cases, he was even able to request that the fighter pilots suspend bombing while he made photographs. About his time on the <em>Bunker Hill</em>, the ship&#8217;s chronicler wrote: &#8220;One day in the South Pacific, a young photographer joined the ship. He came to be a permanent fixture on board, and members of the crew soon came to think of him in terms of what it takes to make an excellent photographer: crazy as hell.&#8221; Smith, thinking as a photojournalist, was often making pictures to help illustrate a story: his images relate to specific events and would have been accompanied by titles and detailed captions. He was also working with pilots in battle, so he did not always have the freedom to make the pictures he envisioned. Smith&#8217;s dramatic and evocative results are thus all the more astonishing.</p>
