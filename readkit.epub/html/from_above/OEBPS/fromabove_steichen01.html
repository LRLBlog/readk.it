				<p>This image captures a rural village and surrounding farmland, perhaps in France. The telltale signature of the narrow French log lot&#8212;part of a patriarchal land inheritance system&#8212;is visible along the drainage above and to the right of the village. This distinctive land-use division appeared in North America where French settlement was concentrated, especially along the St. Lawrence River in Quebec and the lower Mississippi River in Louisiana. The village is strategically positioned at the confluence of two drainages, and morphologically resembles a street-village (what Germans called a strassendorf). The surrounding countryside is largely cultivated to various crops but patches of woodland&#8212;to the right and near the top of the image&#8212;have survived the plow perhaps because these parcels are higher ground too difficult to farm. A system of single lane country roads divides the countryside. &#8212;<a href="fromabove_bio_arreola.html">Daniel Arreola, <em>Cultural Geographer</em></a></p>
				<p>Images like this were the reason European militaries adopted aircraft during World War I. Aerial photography techniques and interpretation developed during the war have remained in use ever since.  While they have adapted to more advanced technology the purposes have remained the same, to see what is on the other side of the hill. &#8212;<a href="fromabove_bio_stemm.html">James Stemm, <em>Curator of Collections, Pima Air &#38; Space Museum</em></a></p>
				<p>A linear, flowing town that&#8212;at initial glance&#8212;would seem to facilitate a quick pass-through. But this is a real destination, connected as it is to its agricultural hinterlands. Farmer and town are conjoined in a perfect blend of urban and rural. &#8212;<a href="fromabove_bio_talen.html"><span class="attribution">Emily&#160;Talen</span></a></p>
