				<p>Located in the lower reaches of the Loire Valley of France, Tours is ornamented by a magnificent Gothic cathedral that is the focal point of this aerial image. The adjacent cloisters reinforce the centrality of the cathedral to the community. Note the wing of Steichenâ€™s airplane at the right edge of the image. &#8212;<a href="fromabove_bio_morgan.html">Keith Morgan, <em>Architectural Historian</em></a></p>
				<p>Mankind's desire to build bigger and more monumentally is an eternal quest. In any given epoch the tallest and most grand buildings illustrate who had the concentration of wealth and power at that time. So in a truly egalitarian society, would we have monuments and what would they be? &#8212;<a href="fromabove_bio_rosano.html">Teresa Rosano, <em>Architect</em></a></p>
