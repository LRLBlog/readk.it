The Pequod Meets The Delight</h2>
<div class="text">
<p>The intense Pequod sailed on; the rolling waves and days went
by; the life-buoy-coffin still lightly swung; and another ship,
most miserably misnamed the Delight, was descried. As she drew
nigh, all eyes were fixed upon her broad beams, called shears,
which, in some whaling-ships, cross the quarter-deck at the height
of eight or nine feet; serving to carry the spare, unrigged, or
disabled boats.</p>
<p>Upon the stranger’s shears were beheld the shattered, white
ribs, and some few splintered planks, of what had once been a
whale-boat; but you now saw through this wreck, as plainly as you
see through the peeled, half-unhinged, and bleaching skeleton of a
horse.</p>
<p>“Hast seen the White Whale?”</p>
<p>“Look!” replied the hollow-cheeked captain from his taffrail;
and with his trumpet he pointed to the wreck.</p>
<p>“Hast killed him?”</p>
<p>“The harpoon is not yet forged that will ever will do that,”
answered the other, sadly glancing upon a rounded hammock on the
deck, whose gathered sides some noiseless sailors were busy in
sewing together.</p>
<p>“Not forged!” and snatching Perth’s levelled iron from the
crotch, Ahab held it out, exclaiming—“Look ye, Nantucketer; here in
this hand I hold his death! Tempered in blood, and tempered by
lightning are these barbs; and I swear to temper them triply in
that hot place behind the fin, where the White Whale most feels his
accursed life!”</p>
<p>“Then God keep thee, old man—see’st thou that”— pointing to the
hammock—“I bury but one of five stout men, who were alive only
yesterday; but were dead ere night. Only that one I bury; the rest
were buried before they died; you sail upon their tomb.” Then
turning to his crew—“Are ye ready there? place the plank then on
the rail, and lift the body; so, then—Oh! God”—advancing towards
the hammock with uplifted hands—“may the resurrection and the
life-”</p>
<p>“Brace forward! Up helm!” cried Ahab like lightning to his
men.</p>
<p>But the suddenly started Pequod was not quick enough to escape
the sound of the splash that the corpse soon made as it struck the
sea; not so quick, indeed, but that some of the flying bubbles
might have sprinkled her hull with their ghostly baptism.</p>
<p>As Ahab now glided from the dejected Delight, the strange
life-buoy hanging at the Pequod’s stern came into conspicuous
relief.</p>
<p>“Ha! yonder! look yonder, men!” cried a foreboding voice in her
wake. “In vain, oh, ye strangers, ye fly our sad burial; ye but
turn us your taffrail to show us your coffin!”</p>
