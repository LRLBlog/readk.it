<p>(Stubb solus, and mending a brace.)</p>
<p>Ha! ha! ha! ha! hem! clear my throat!—I’ve been thinking over it
ever since, and that ha, ha’s the final consequence. Why so?
Because a laugh’s the wisest, easiest answer to all that’s queer;
and come what will, one comfort’s always left— that unfailing
comfort is, it’s all predestinated. I heard not all his talk with
Starbuck; but to my poor eye Starbuck then looked something as I
the other evening felt. Be sure the old Mogul has fixed him, too. I
twigged it, knew it; had had the gift, might readily have
prophesied it—for when I clapped my eye upon his skull I saw it.
Well, Stubb, wise Stubb— that’s my title—well, Stubb, what of it,
Stubb? Here’s a carcase. I know not all that may be coming, but be
it what it will, I’ll go to it laughing. Such a waggish leering as
lurks in all your horribles! I feel funny. Fa, la! lirra, skirra!
What’s my juicy little pear at home doing now? Crying its eyes
out?— Giving a party to the last arrived harpooneers, I dare say,
gay as a frigate’s pennant, and so am I—fa, la! lirra, skirra!
Oh—</p>
<p>We’ll drink to-night with hearts as light,</p>
<p>To love, as gay and fleeting</p>
<p>As bubbles that swim, on the beaker’s brim,</p>
<p>And break on the lips while meeting.</p>
<p>A brave stave that—who calls? Mr. Starbuck? Aye, aye, sir—
(Aside) he’s my superior, he has his too, if I’m not mistaken.—
Aye, aye, sir, just through with this job—coming.</p>
