Usher to a Grammar School)</h3>
<div class="text">
<p>The pale Usher—threadbare in coat, heart, body, and brain; I see
him now. He was ever dusting his old lexicons and grammars, with a
queer handkerchief, mockingly embellished with all the gay flags of
all the known nations of the world. He loved to dust his old
grammars; it somehow mildly reminded him of his mortality.</p>
<p>“While you take in hand to school others, and to teach them
by</p>
<p>what name a whale-fish is to be called in our tongue leaving
out, through ignorance, the letter H, which almost alone maketh the
signification of the word, you deliver that which is not true.”</p>

roundness</p>

<p>“WHALE… . It is more immediately from the Dut. and Ger.</p>
<p>Wallen; A.S. Walw-ian, to roll, to wallow.”</p>
