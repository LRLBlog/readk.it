Sub-Sub-Librarian).</h3>
<div class="text">
<p>It will be seen that this mere painstaking burrower and
grub-worm of a poor devil of a Sub-Sub appears to have gone through
the long Vaticans and street-stalls of the earth, picking up
whatever random allusions to whales he could anyways find in any
book whatsoever, sacred or profane. therefore you must not, in
every case at least, take the higgledy-piggledy whale statements,
however authentic, in these extracts, for veritable gospel
cetology. Far from it. As touching the ancient authors generally,
as well as the poets here appearing, these extracts are solely
valuable or entertaining, as affording a glancing bird’s eye view
of what has been promiscuously said, thought, fancied, and sung of
Leviathan, by many nations and generations, including our own.</p>
<p>So fare thee well, poor devil of a Sub-Sub, whose commentator I
am. Thou belongest to that hopeless, sallow tribe which no wine of
this world will ever warm; and for whom even Pale Sherry would be
too rosy-strong; but with whom one sometimes loves to sit, and feel
poor-devilish, too; and grow convivial upon tears; and say to them
bluntly, with full eyes and empty glasses, and in not altogether
unpleasant sadness— Give it up, Sub-Subs! For by how much more
pains ye take to please the world, by so much the more shall ye for
ever go thankless! Would that I could clear out Hampton Court and
the Tuileries for ye! But gulp down your tears and hie aloft to the
royal-mast with your hearts; for your friends who have gone before
are clearing out the seven-storied heavens, and making refugees of
long pampered Gabriel, Michael, and Raphael, against your coming.
Here ye strike but splintered hearts together—there, ye shall
strike unsplinterable glasses!</p>

sea.”</p>
<p>—ISAIAH</p>
<p>“And what thing soever besides cometh within the chaos of
this</p>

<p>“Scarcely had we proceeded two days on the sea, when about
sunrise a</p>
<p>great many Whales and other monsters of the sea, appeared. Among
the former, one was of a most monstrous size… . This came towards
us, open-mouthed, raising the waves on all sides, and beating the
sea before him into a foam.”</p>
<p>—TOOKE’S LUCIAN. “THE TRUE HISTORY.”</p>
<p>“He visited this country also with a view of catching</p>
<p>horse-whales, which had bones of very great value for their
teeth, of which he brought some to the king… . The best whales were
catched in his own country, of which some were forty-eight, some
fifty yards long. He said that he was one of six who had killed
sixty in two days.”</p>

it in great security, and there sleeps.”</p>

<p>“There Leviathan,</p>
<p>Hugest of living creatures, in the deep</p>
<p>Stretched like a promontory sleeps or swims,</p>
<p>And seems a moving land; and at his gills</p>
<p>Draws in, and at his breath spouts out a sea.”</p>

<p>—DRYDEN’S ANNUS MIRABILIS.</p>
<p>“While the whale is floating at the stern of the ship, they
cut</p>
<p>off his head, and tow it with a boat as near the shore as it
will come; but it will be aground in twelve or thirteen feet
water.”</p>
<p>—THOMAS EDGE’S TEN VOYAGES TO SPITZBERGEN, IN PURCHAS.</p>
<p>“In their way they saw many whales sporting in the ocean, and
in</p>
<p>wantonness fuzzing up the water through their pipes and vents,
which nature has placed on their shoulders.”</p>
<p>—SIR T. HERBERT’S VOYAGES INTO ASIA AND AFRICA. HARRIS COLL.</p>

forced</p>
<p>to proceed with a great deal of caution for fear they should run
their ship upon them.”</p>
<p>—SCHOUTEN’S SIXTH CIRCUMNAVIGATION.</p>
<p>“We set sail from the Elbe, wind N. E. in the ship called
The</p>
<p>Jonas-in-the-Whale… .</p>
<p>Some say the whale can’t open his mouth, but that is a fable…
.</p>
<p>They frequently climb up the masts to see whether they can see
a</p>
<p>whale, for the first discoverer has a ducat for his pains… .</p>
<p>I was told of a whale taken near Shetland, that had above a
barrel</p>
<p>of herrings in his belly… .</p>
<p>One of our harpooneers told me that he caught once a whale
in</p>
<p>Spitzbergen that was white all over.”</p>
<p>—A VOYAGE TO GREENLAND, A.D. 1671 HARRIS COLL.</p>
<p>“Several whales have come in upon this coast (Fife) Anno 1652,
one</p>
<p>eighty feet in length of the whale-bone kind came in, which (as
I was informed), besides a vast quantity of oil, did afford 500
weight of baleen. The jaws of it stand for a gate in the garden of
Pitferren.”</p>
<p>—SIBBALD’S FIFE AND KINROSS.</p>
<p>“Myself have agreed to try whether I can master and kill
this</p>
<p>Sperma-ceti whale, for I could never hear of any of that sort
that was killed by any man, such is his fierceness and
swiftness.”</p>

those</p>

to the northward of us.”</p>
<p>—CAPTAIN COWLEY’S VOYAGE ROUND THE GLOBE, A.D. 1729.</p>

<p>such an insupportable smell, as to bring on a disorder of the
brain.”</p>
<p>—ULLOA’S SOUTH AMERICA.</p>
<p>“To fifty chosen sylphs of special note,</p>
<p>We trust the important charge, the petticoat.</p>
<p>Oft have we known that seven-fold fence to fail,</p>

<p>—RAPE OF THE LOCK.</p>
<p>“If we compare land animals in respect to magnitude, with those
that</p>
<p>take up their abode in the deep, we shall find they will appear
contemptible in the comparison. The whale is doubtless the largest
animal in creation.”</p>
<p>—GOLDSMITH, NAT. HIST.</p>
<p>“If you should write a fable for little fishes, you would
make</p>
<p>them speak like great wales.”</p>
<p>—GOLDSMITH TO JOHNSON.</p>
<p>“In the afternoon we saw what was supposed to be a rock, but
it</p>
<p>was found to be a dead whale, which some Asiatics had killed,
and were then towing ashore. They seemed to endeavor to conceal
themselves behind the whale, in order to avoid being seen by
us.”</p>
<p>—COOK’S VOYAGES.</p>
<p>“The larger whales, they seldom venture to attack. They stand
in</p>
<p>so great dread of some of them, that when out at sea they are
afraid to mention even their names, and carry dung, lime-stone,
juniper-wood, and some other articles of the same nature in their
boats, in order to terrify and prevent their too near
approach.”</p>
<p>—UNO VON TROIL’S LETTERS ON BANKS’S AND SOLANDER’S</p>
<p>VOYAGE TO ICELAND IN 1772.</p>

<p>“A tenth branch of the king’s ordinary revenue, said to be</p>
<p>grounded on the consideration of his guarding and protecting the
seas from pirates and robbers, is the right to royal fish, which
are whale and sturgeon. And these, when either thrown ashore or
caught near the coast, are the property of the king.”</p>

<p>Had never seen; from dread Leviathan</p>
<p>To insect millions peopling every wave:</p>

<p>—CHARLES LAMB’S TRIUMPH OF THE WHALE.</p>
<p>“In the year 1690 some persons were on a high hill observing
the</p>

there—pointing to the sea—is a green pasture where our children’s
grand-children will go for bread.”</p>

<p>“No, Sir, ’tis a Right Whale,” answered Tom; “I saw his sprout;

<p>CHACE OF NANTUCKET, FIRST MATE OF SAID VESSEL. NEW</p>
<p>YORK, 1821.</p>
<p>“A mariner sat in the shrouds one night,</p>
<p>The wind was piping free;</p>
<p>Now bright, now dimmed, was the moonlight pale,</p>
<p>And the phospher gleamed in the wake of the whale,</p>
<p>As it floundered in the sea.”</p>
<p>—ELIZABETH OAKES SMITH.</p>
<p>“The quantity of line withdrawn from the boats engaged in the
capture of this one whale, amounted altogether to 10,440 yards or
nearly six English miles… .</p>
<p>“Sometimes the whale shakes its tremendous tail in the air,
which,</p>
<p>cracking like a whip, resounds to the distance of three or four
miles.”</p>
<p>—SCORESBY.</p>
<p>“Mad with the agonies he endures from these fresh attacks,
the</p>
<p>infuriated Sperm Whale rolls over and over; he rears his
enormous head, and with wide expanded jaws snaps at everything
around him; he rushes at the boats with his head; they are
propelled before him with vast swiftness, and sometimes utterly
destroyed.</p>
<p>… It is a matter of great astonishment that the consideration
of</p>
<p>the habits of so interesting, and, in a commercial point of
view, so important an animal (as the Sperm Whale) should have been
so entirely neglected, or should have excited so little curiosity
among the numerous, and many of them competent observers, that of
late years, must have possessed the most abundant and the most
convenient opportunities of witnessing their habitudes.”</p>
<p>—THOMAS BEALE’S HISTORY OF THE SPERM WHALE, 1839.</p>
<p>“The Cachalot” (Sperm Whale) “is not only better armed than the
True</p>
<p>Whale” (Greenland or Right Whale) “in possessing a formidable
weapon at either extremity of its body, but also more frequently
displays a disposition to employ these weapons offensively and in
manner at once so artful, bold, and mischievous, as to lead to its
being regarded as the most dangerous to attack of all the known
species of the whale tribe.”</p>

inevitable.”</p>
