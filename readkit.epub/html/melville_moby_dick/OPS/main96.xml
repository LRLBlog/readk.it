The Cassock</h2>
<div class="text">
<p>Had you stepped on board the Pequod at a certain juncture of
this post-mortemizing of the whale; and had you strolled forward
nigh the windlass, pretty sure am I that you would have scanned
with no small curiosity a very strange, enigmatical object, which
you would have seen there, lying along lengthwise in the lee
scuppers. Not the wondrous cistern in the whale’s huge head; not
the prodigy of his unhinged lower jaw; not the miracle of his
symmetrical tail; none of these would so surprise you, as half a
glimpse of that unaccountable cone,—longer than a Kentuckian is
tall, nigh a foot in diameter at the base, and jet-black as Yojo,
the ebony idol of Queequeg. And an idol, indeed, it is; or rather,
in old times, its likeness was. Such an idol as that found in the
secret groves of Queen Maachah in Judea; and for worshipping which,
King Asa, her son, did depose her, and destroyed the idol, and
burnt it for an abomination at the brook Kedron, as darkly set
forth in the 15th chapter of the First Book of Kings.</p>
<p>Look at the sailor, called the mincer, who now comes along, and
assisted by two allies, heavily backs the grandissimus, as the
mariners call it, and with bowed shoulders, staggers off with it as
if he were a grenadier carrying a dead comrade from the field.
Extending it upon the forecastle deck, he now proceeds
cylindrically to remove its dark pelt, as an African hunter the
pelt of a boa. This done he turns the pelt inside out, like a
pantaloon leg; gives it a good stretching, so as almost to double
its diameter; and at last hangs it, well spread, in the rigging, to
dry. Ere long, it is taken down; when removing some three feet of
it, towards the pointed extremity, and then cutting two slits for
arm-holes at the other end, he lengthwise slips himself bodily into
it. The mincer now stands before you invested in the full
canonicals of his calling. Immemorial to all his order, this
investiture alone will adequately protect him, while employed in
the peculiar functions of his office.</p>
<p>That office consists in mincing the horse-pieces of blubber for
the pots; an operation which is conducted at a curious wooden
horse, planted endwise against the bulwarks, and with a capacious
tub beneath it, into which the minced pieces drop, fast as the
sheets from a rapt orator’s desk. Arrayed in decent black;
occupying a conspicuous pulpit; intent on bible leaves; what a
candidate for an archbishopric, what a lad for a Pope were this
mincer!<a class="footnote" href="footnotes.xml#footnote_20" id=
