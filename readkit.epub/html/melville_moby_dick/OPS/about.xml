<p>Herman Melville (August 1, 1819 – September 28, 1891) was an
American novelist, short story writer, essayist, and poet. His
earliest novels were bestsellers, but his popularity declined later
in his life. By the time of his death he had virtually been
forgotten, but his longest novel, Moby-Dick — largely considered a
failure during his lifetime, and responsible for Melville's drop in
popularity — was rediscovered in the 20th century as a literary
masterpiece. Source: Wikipedia</p>
