<p>“And I only am escaped alone to tell thee”</p>
<p>Job.</p>
<p>The drama’s done. Why then here does any one step forth?—
Because one did survive the wreck.</p>
<p>It so chanced, that after the Parsee’s disappearance, I was he
whom the Fates ordained to take the place of Ahab’s bowsman, when
that bowsman assumed the vacant post; the same, who, when on the
last day the three men were tossed from out of the rocking boat,
was dropped astern. So, floating on the margin of the ensuing
scene, and in full sight of it, when the halfspent suction of the
sunk ship reached me, I was then, but slowly, drawn towards the
closing vortex. When I reached it, it had subsided to a creamy
pool. Round and round, then, and ever contracting towards the
button-like black bubble at the axis of that slowly wheeling
circle, like another Ixion I did revolve. Till, gaining that vital
centre, the black bubble upward burst; and now, liberated by reason
of its cunning spring, and, owing to its great buoyancy, rising
with great force, the coffin life-buoy shot lengthwise from the
sea, fell over, and floated by my side. Buoyed up by that coffin,
for almost one whole day and night, I floated on a soft and
dirgelike main. The unharming sharks, they glided by as if with
padlocks on their mouths; the savage sea-hawks sailed with sheathed
beaks. On the second day, a sail drew near, nearer, and picked me
up at last. It was the devious-cruising Rachel, that in her
retracing search after her missing children, only found another
orphan.</p>
