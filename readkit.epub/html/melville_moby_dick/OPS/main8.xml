The Chapel</h2>
<div class="text">
<p>In this same New Bedford there stands a Whaleman’s Chapel, and
few are the moody fishermen, shortly bound for the Indian Ocean or
Pacific, who fail to make a Sunday visit to the spot. I am sure
that I did not.</p>
<p>Returning from my first morning stroll, I again sallied out upon
this special errand. The sky had changed from clear, sunny cold, to
driving sleet and mist. Wrapping myself in my shaggy jacket of the
cloth called bearskin, I fought my way against the stubborn storm.
Entering, I found a small scattered congregation of sailors, and
sailors’ wives and widows. A muffled silence reigned, only broken
at times by the shrieks of the storm. Each silent worshipper seemed
purposely sitting apart from the other, as if each silent grief
were insular and incommunicable. The chaplain had not yet arrived;
and there these silent islands of men and women sat steadfastly
eyeing several marble tablets, with black borders, masoned into the
wall on either side the pulpit. Three of them ran something like
the following, but I do not pretend to quote:</p>
<p>SACRED</p>
<p>to the memory</p>
<p>of</p>
<p>John TALBOT,</p>
<p>Who, at the age of eighteen, was lost overboard</p>
<p>Near the Isle of Desolation, off Patagonia,</p>
<p>November 1st, 1836.</p>
<p>This tablet</p>
<p>Is erected to his Memory</p>
<p>by his sister.</p>
<p>SACRED</p>
<p>to the memory</p>
<p>of</p>
<p>ROBERT long, WILLIS ELLERY,</p>
<p>Nathan COLEMAN, WALTER CANNY, SETH Macy,</p>
<p>and Samuel GLEIG,</p>
<p>Forming one of the boats’ crews</p>
<p>of</p>
<p>the ship ELIZA</p>
<p>Who were towed out of sight by a Whale,</p>
<p>On the Off-shore Ground in the</p>
<p>Pacific,</p>
<p>December 31st, 1839.</p>
<p>This marble</p>
<p>Is here placed by their surviving</p>
<p>shipmates.</p>
<p>SACRED</p>
<p>to the memory</p>
<p>of</p>
<p>The late</p>
<p>captain Ezekiel hardy,</p>
<p>Who in the bows of his boat was killed by a</p>
<p>Sperm Whale on the coast of Japan,</p>
<p>August 3d, 1833.</p>
<p>This tablet</p>
<p>Is erected to his Memory</p>
<p>by</p>
<p>his widow.</p>
<p>Shaking off the sleet from my ice-glazed hat and jacket, I
seated myself near the door, and turning sideways was surprised to
see Queequeg near me. Affected by the solemnity of the scene, there
was a wondering gaze of incredulous curiosity in his countenance.
This savage was the only person present who seemed to notice my
entrance; because he was the only one who could not read, and,
therefore, was not reading those frigid inscriptions on the wall.
Whether any of the relatives of the seamen whose names appeared
there were now among the congregation, I knew not; but so many are
the unrecorded accidents in the fishery, and so plainly did several
women present wear the countenance if not the trappings of some
unceasing grief, that I feel sure that here before me were
assembled those, in whose unhealing hearts the sight of those bleak
tablets sympathetically caused the old wounds to bleed afresh.</p>
<p>Oh! ye whose dead lie buried beneath the green grass; who
standing among flowers can say—here, here lies my beloved; ye know
not the desolation that broods in bosoms like these. What bitter
blanks in those black-bordered marbles which cover no ashes! What
despair in those immovable inscriptions! What deadly voids and
unbidden infidelities in the lines that seem to gnaw upon all
Faith, and refuse resurrections to the beings who have placelessly
perished without a grave. As well might those tablets stand in the
cave of Elephanta as here.</p>
<p>In what census of living creatures, the dead of mankind are
included; why it is that a universal proverb says of them, that
they tell no tales, though containing more secrets than the Goodwin
Sands! how it is that to his name who yesterday departed for the
other world, we prefix so significant and infidel a word, and yet
do not thus entitle him, if he but embarks for the remotest Indies
of this living earth; why the Life Insurance Companies pay
death-forfeitures upon immortals; in what eternal, unstirring
paralysis, and deadly, hopeless trance, yet lies antique Adam who
died sixty round centuries ago; how it is that we still refuse to
be comforted for those who we nevertheless maintain are dwelling in
unspeakable bliss; why all the living so strive to hush all the
dead; wherefore but the rumor of a knocking in a tomb will terrify
a whole city. All these things are not without their meanings.</p>
<p>But Faith, like a jackal, feeds among the tombs, and even from
these dead doubts she gathers her most vital hope.</p>
<p>It needs scarcely to be told, with what feelings, on the eve of
a Nantucket voyage, I regarded those marble tablets, and by the
murky light of that darkened, doleful day read the fate of the
whalemen who had gone before me. Yes, Ishmael, the same fate may be
thine. But somehow I grew merry again. Delightful inducements to
embark, fine chance for promotion, it seems—aye, a stove boat will
make me an immortal by brevet. Yes, there is death in this business
of whaling—a speechlessly quick chaotic bundling of a man into
Eternity. But what then? Methinks we have hugely mistaken this
matter of Life and Death. Methinks that what they call my shadow
here on earth is my true substance. Methinks that in looking at
things spiritual, we are too much like oysters observing the sun
through the water, and thinking that thick water the thinnest of
air. Methinks my body is but the lees of my better being. In fact
take my body who will, take it I say, it is not me. And therefore
three cheers for Nantucket; and come a stove boat and stove body
when they will, for stave my soul, Jove himself cannot.</p>
