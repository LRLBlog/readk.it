<div class="footnote" id="footnote_2"><a class="marker" href=
"main33.xml#footnote_2_call">[2]</a> <span class="isfootnote">I am
aware that down to the present time, the fish styled Lamatins and
Dugongs (Pig-fish and Sow-fish of the Coffins of Nantucket) are
included by many naturalists among the whales. But as these
pig-fish are a noisy, contemptible set, mostly lurking in the
mouths of rivers, and feeding on wet hay, and especially as they do
not spout, I deny their credentials as whales; and have presented
them with their passports to quit the Kingdom of
Cetology.</span></div>
<div class="footnote" id="footnote_3"><a class="marker" href=
"main33.xml#footnote_3_call">[3]</a> <span class="isfootnote">Why
this book of whales is not denominated the Quarto is very plain.
Because, while the whales of this order, though smaller than those
of the former order, nevertheless retain a proportionate likeness
to them in figure, yet the bookbinder’s Quarto volume in its
dimensioned form does not preserve the shape of the Folio volume,
but the Octavo volume does.</span></div>
<div class="footnote" id="footnote_4"><a class="marker" href=
"main43.xml#footnote_4_call">[4]</a> <span class="isfootnote">With
reference to the Polar bear, it may possibly be urged by him who
would fain go still deeper into this matter, that it is not the
whiteness, separately regarded, which heightens the intolerable
hideousness of that brute; for, analysed, that heightened
hideousness, it might be said, only rises from the circumstance,
that the irresponsible ferociousness of the creature stands
invested in the fleece of celestial innocence and love; and hence,
by bringing together two such opposite emotions in our minds, the
Polar bear frightens us with so unnatural a contrast. But even
assuming all this to be true; yet, were it not for the whiteness,
you would not have that intensified terror. As for the white shark,
the white gliding ghostliness of repose in that creature, when
beheld in his ordinary moods, strangely tallies with the same
quality in the Polar quadruped. This peculiarity is most vividly
hit by the French in the name they bestow upon that fish. The
Romish mass for the dead begins with “Requiem eternam” (eternal
rest), whence Requiem denominating the mass itself, and any other
funeral music. Now, in allusion to the white, silent stillness of
death in this shark, and the mild deadliness of his habits, the
French call him Requin.</span></div>
<div class="footnote" id="footnote_5"><a class="marker" href=
"main43.xml#footnote_5_call">[5]</a> <span class="isfootnote">I
remember the first albatross I ever saw. It was during a prolonged
gale, in waters hard upon the Antarctic seas. From my forenoon
watch below, I ascended to the overclouded deck; and there, dashed
upon the main hatches, I saw a regal, feathery thing of unspotted
whiteness, and with a hooked, Roman bill sublime. At intervals, it
arched forth its vast archangel wings, as if to embrace some holy
ark. Wondrous flutterings and throbbings shook it. Though bodily
unharmed, it uttered cries, as some king’s ghost in supernatural
distress. Through its inexpressible, strange eyes, methought I
peeped to secrets which took hold of God. As Abraham before the
angels, I bowed myself; the white thing was so white, its wings so
wide, and in those for ever exiled waters, I had lost the miserable
warping memories of traditions and of towns. Long I gazed at that
prodigy of plumage. I cannot tell, can only hint, the things that
darted through me then. But at last I awoke; and turning, asked a
sailor what bird was this. A goney, he replied. Goney! never had
heard that name before; is it conceivable that this glorious thing
is utterly unknown to men ashore! never! But some time after, I
learned that goney was some seaman’s name for albatross. So that by
no possibility could Coleridge’s wild Rhyme have had aught to do
with those mystical impressions which were mine, when I saw that
bird upon our deck. For neither had I then read the Rhyme, nor knew
the bird to be an albatross. Yet, in saying this, I do but
indirectly burnish a little brighter the noble merit of the poem
and the poet.</span></div>

following are extracts from Chace’s narrative: “Every fact seemed
to warrant me in concluding that it was anything but chance which
directed his operations; he made two several attacks upon the ship,
at a short interval between them, both of this catastrophe I have
never chanced to their direction, were calculated to do us the
whale hunters I have now and then heard casual allusions to
it.</span></div>
<div class="footnote" id="footnote_7"><a class="marker" href=

cabin-compass is called the tell-tale, because without going to the

<div class="footnote" id="footnote_8"><a class="marker" href=

ancient whale-cry upon first sighting a whale from the mast-head,
still used by whalemen in hunting the famous Gallipagos

<div class="footnote" id="footnote_9"><a class="marker" href=
"main59.xml#footnote_9_call">[9]</a> <span class="isfootnote">That
part of the sea known among whalemen as the “Brazil Banks” does not
bear that name as the Banks of Newfoundland do, because of there
being shallows and soundings there, but because of this remarkable
meadow-like appearance, caused by the vast drifts of brit
continually floating in those latitudes, where the Right Whale is
often chased.</span></div>
<div class="footnote" id="footnote_10"><a class="marker" href=
"main62.xml#footnote_10_call">[10]</a> <span class="isfootnote">It
will be seen in some other place of what a very light substance the
entire interior of the sperm whale’s enormous head consists. Though
apparently the most massive, it is by far the most buoyant part
about him. So that with ease he elevates it in the air, and
invariably does so when going at his utmost speed. Besides, such is
the breadth of the upper part of the front of his head, and such
the tapering cut-water formation of the lower part, that by
obliquely elevating his head, he thereby may be said to transform
himself from a bluff-bowed sluggish galliot into a sharppointed New
York pilot-boat.</span></div>
<div class="footnote" id="footnote_11"><a class="marker" href=
"main62.xml#footnote_11_call">[11]</a> <span class=
"isfootnote">Partly to show the indispensableness of this act, it
may here be stated, that, in the old Dutch fishery, a mop was used
to dash the running line with water; in many other ships, a wooden
piggin, or bailer, is set apart for that purpose. Your hat,
however, is the most convenient.</span></div>
<div class="footnote" id="footnote_12"><a class="marker" href=
"main65.xml#footnote_12_call">[12]</a> <span class="isfootnote">A
little item may as well be related here. The strongest and most
reliable hold which the ship has upon the whale when moored
alongside, is by the flukes or tail; and as from its greater
density that part is relatively heavier than any other (excepting
the side-fins), its flexibility even in death, causes it to sink
low beneath the surface; so that with the hand you cannot get at it
from the boat, in order to put the chain round it. But this
difficulty is ingeniously overcome: a small, strong line is
prepared with a wooden float at its outer end, and a weight in its
middle, while the other end is secured to the ship. By adroit
management the wooden float is made to rise on the other side of
the mass, so that now having girdled the whale, the chain is
readily made to follow suit; and being slipped along the body, is
at last locked fast round the smallest part of the tail, at the
point of junction with its broad flukes or lobes.</span></div>
<div class="footnote" id="footnote_13"><a class="marker" href=
"main67.xml#footnote_13_call">[13]</a> <span class="isfootnote">The
whaling-spade used for cutting-in is made of the very best steel;
is about the bigness of a man’s spread hand; and in general shape,
corresponds to the garden implement after which it is named; only
its sides are perfectly flat, and its upper end considerably
narrower than the lower. This weapon is always kept as sharp as
possible; and when being used is occasionally honed, just like a
razor. In its socket, a stiff pole, from twenty to thirty feet
long, is inserted for a handle.</span></div>
<div class="footnote" id="footnote_14"><a class="marker" href=
"main73.xml#footnote_14_call">[14]</a> <span class="isfootnote">The
monkey-rope is found in all whalers; but it was only in the Pequod
that the monkey and his holder were ever tied together. This
improvement upon the original usage was introduced by no less a man
than Stubb, in order to afford to the imperilled harpooneer the
strongest possible guarantee for the faithfulness and vigilance of
his monkey-rope holder.</span></div>
<div class="footnote" id="footnote_15"><a class="marker" href=
"main76.xml#footnote_15_call">[15]</a> <span class=
"isfootnote">This reminds us that the Right Whale really has a sort
of whisker, or rather a moustache, consisting of a few scattered
white hairs on the upper part of the outer end of the lower jaw.
Sometimes these tufts impart a rather brigandish expression to his
otherwise solemn countenance.</span></div>
<div class="footnote" id="footnote_16"><a class="marker" href=
"main78.xml#footnote_16_call">[16]</a> <span class=
"isfootnote">Quoin is not a Euclidean term. It belongs to the pure
nautical mathematics. I know not that it has been defined before. A
quoin is a solid which differs from a wedge in having its sharp end
formed by the steep inclination of one side, instead of the mutual
tapering of both sides.</span></div>
<div class="footnote" id="footnote_17"><a class="marker" href=
"main87.xml#footnote_17_call">[17]</a> <span class=
"isfootnote">Though all comparison in the way of general bulk
between the whale and the elephant is preposterous, inasmuch as in
that particular the elephant stands in much the same respect to the
whale that a dog does to the elephant; nevertheless, there are not
wanting some points of curious similitude; among these is the
spout. It is well known that the elephant will often draw up water
or dust in his trunk, and then elevating it, jet it forth in a
stream.</span></div>
<div class="footnote" id="footnote_18"><a class="marker" href=
"main88.xml#footnote_18_call">[18]</a> <span class="isfootnote">To
gally, or gallow, is to frighten excessively— to confound with
fright. It is an old Saxon word. It occurs once in Shakespeare:—
The wrathful skies Gallow the very wanderers of the dark And make
them keep their caves. To common language, the word is now
completely obsolete. When the polite landsman first hears it from
the gaunt Nantucketer, he is apt to set it down as one of the
whaleman’s self-derived savageries. Much the same is it with many
other sinewy Saxonisms of this sort, which emigrated to New-England
rocks with the noble brawn of the old English emigrants in the time
of the Commonwealth. Thus, some of the best and furthest-descended
English words—the etymological Howards and Percys—are now
democratised, nay, plebeianised—so to speak— in the New
World.</span></div>
<div class="footnote" id="footnote_19"><a class="marker" href=
"main88.xml#footnote_19_call">[19]</a> <span class="isfootnote">The
sperm whale, as with all other species of the Leviathan, but unlike
most other fish, breeds indifferently at all seasons; after a
gestation which may probably be set down at nine months, producing
but one at a time; though in some few known instances giving birth
to an Esau and Jacob:—a contingency provided for in suckling by two
teats, curiously situated, one on each side of the anus; but the
breasts themselves extend upwards from that. When by chance these
precious parts in a nursing whale are cut by the hunter’s lance,
the mother’s pouring milk and blood rivallingly discolor the sea
for rods. The milk is very sweet and rich; it has been tasted by
man; it might do well with strawberries. When overflowing with
mutual esteem, the whales salute more hominum.</span></div>
<div class="footnote" id="footnote_20"><a class="marker" href=
"main96.xml#footnote_20_call">[20]</a> <span class=
"isfootnote">Bible leaves! Bible leaves! This is the invariable cry
from the mates to the mincer. It enjoins him to be careful, and cut
his work into as thin slices as possible, inasmuch as by so doing
the business of boiling out the oil is much accelerated, and its
quantity considerably increased, besides perhaps improving it in
quality.</span></div>
<div class="footnote" id="footnote_21"><a class="marker" href=
"main110.xml#footnote_21_call">[21]</a> <span class="isfootnote">In
Sperm-whalemen with any considerable quantity of oil on board, it
is a regular semiweekly duty to conduct a hose into the hold, and
drench the casks with sea-water; which afterwards, at varying
intervals, is removed by the ship’s pumps. Hereby the casks are
sought to be kept damply tight; while by the changed character of
the withdrawn water, the mariners readily detect any serious
leakage in the precious cargo.</span></div>
<div class="footnote" id="footnote_22"><a class="marker" href=
"main134.xml#footnote_22_call">[22]</a> <span class=

receives its designation (pitchpoling) from its being likened to
that preliminary up-and-down poise of the whale-lance, in the
exercise called pitchpoling, previously described. By this motion
the whale must best and most comprehensively view whatever objects
may be encircling him.</span></div>
