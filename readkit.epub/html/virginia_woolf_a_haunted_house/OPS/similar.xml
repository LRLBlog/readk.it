Dalloway</em></a>
<p>Mrs Dalloway (published on 14 May 1925) is a novel by Virginia
Woolf that details a day in the life of Clarissa Dalloway in
post-World War I England. Mrs Dalloway continues to be one of
Woolf's best-known novels.<br />
Created from two short stories, "Mrs Dalloway in Bond Street" and
the unfinished "The Prime Minister", the novel's story is of
Clarissa's preparations for a party of which she is to be hostess.
With the interior perspective of the novel, the story travels
forwards and back in time, and in and out of the characters' minds,
to construct a complete image of Clarissa's life and of the
inter-war social structure.</p>

<a href="http://generation.feedbooks.com/book/1234.epub"><em>To the
Lighthouse</em></a>
<p>To the Lighthouse (5 May 1927) is a novel by Virginia Woolf. A
landmark novel of high modernism, the text, centering on the Ramsay
family and their visits to the Isle of Skye in Scotland between
1910 and 1920, skillfully manipulates temporality and psychological
exploration.<br />
To the Lighthouse follows and extends the tradition of modernist
novelists like Marcel Proust and James Joyce, where the plot is
secondary to philosophical introspection, and the prose can be
winding and hard to follow. The novel includes little dialogue and
almost no action; most of it is written as thoughts and
observations. The novel recalls the power of childhood emotions and
highlights the impermanence of adult relationships. One of the
book's several themes is the ubiquity of transience.</p>

Waves</em></a>
<p>One of Woolf’s most experimental novels, The Waves presents six
characters in monologue - from morning until night, from childhood
into old age - against a background of the sea. The result is a
glorious chorus of voices that exists not to remark on the passing
of events but to celebrate the connection between its various
individual parts.</p>

Acts</em></a>
<p>In Woolf’s last novel, the action takes place on one summer’s
day at a country house in the heart of England, where the villagers

valedictory.</p>

Canterville Ghost</em></a>
<p>The Canterville Ghost is a popular 1887 novella by Oscar Wilde,
widely adapted for the screen and stage.<br />
“The Canterville Ghost” is a parody featuring a dramatic spirit
named Sir Simon and the United States minister (ambassador) to the
Court of St. James's, Hiram B. Otis. Mr. Otis travels to England
with his family and moves into a haunted country house. Lord
Canterville, the previous owner of the house, warns Mr. Otis that
the ghost of Sir Simon de Canterville has haunted it ever since he
killed his wife, Eleonore, three centuries before. But Mr. Otis
dismisses the ghost story as bunk and disregards Lord Canterville’s
warnings. When the Otises learn that the house is indeed haunted,
they succeed in victimizing the ghost and in disregarding age-old
British traditions. What emerges is a satire of American
materialism, a lampoon of traditional British values, and an
amusing twist on the traditional gothic horror tale.</p>
