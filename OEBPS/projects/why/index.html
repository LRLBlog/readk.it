			<h3>Why is readk.it needed?</h3>
			<p>Readk.it offers a simple solution to one of biggest problems of modern eBooks: that of the inadequate and inconsistent presentation functionality offered by the competing vendor reading systems.</p>

			<p>From this problem stem a number of other problems affecting eBook publishers:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Different vendor reading systems means publishers have to maintain different digital versions of a given title.</li>
				<li>Vendor reading systems offer inconsistent and incomplete support for HTML5 and CSS3, the technologies on which EPUB eBooks are built. Much more is possible in terms of rich content presentation using a modern web browser than is available in most vendor reading systems.</li>
				<li>The various differences in the vendor reading systems means that publishers have less control  over and certainty about the presentation of their content; a bug that is currently being worked around in a vendor's reading system may be fixed in a new release, while this new release may introduce other bugs that affect content presentation.</li>
				<li>The multitude of vendor reading systems serving different parts of the reading market means that it is difficult for a publisher to easily offer their titles to the reading public en masse.</li>
			</ul>

			<h3>The problem with dedicated eBook reading systems</h3>
			<p>Given that eBook reading systems have a narrower focus than a web browser, you would think that their task of suitably and faithfully presenting eBook content as per the publisher's wishes would be acheivable.</p>

			<p>However, unfortunately this is not the case.</p>

			<h4>Vendor reading systems and the pace of change</h4>
			<p>Vendor reading systems are finding it hard to keep up with the pace of change; both HTML and CSS are evolving standards, with HTML5 not yet ratified, although EPUB3 is regarded as a complete standard. This leads to difficulties and inconsistencies for reading system vendors as they have to make choices about which features of HTML and CSS to implement without breaking the presentation of eBooks already in the market.</p>

			<p>Although this is also a problem for browser manufacturers, they are able to adapt more quickly as:</p>

			<ul>
				<li>Browser manufacturers typically have more resources (either internally or in the form of wide communities of support) than many reading systems vendors.</li>
				<li>Many browser manufacturers have developed a system of automatic deployment of new versions, such that your computer will continually check-in to determine whether the browser needs updating.</li>
			</ul>

			<h4>EPUB3: a complicated standard</h4>
			<p>Although there is much of good in the EPUB3 standard, it is proving problematic because it is a complex standard based on still-evolving technologies. Added to this is the fact that it also has a certain lattitude for implementation of certain features.</p>

			<p>Much of what publishers actually wish to achieve in terms of presentation of their content can be acheived using the web browser, as proven by <a href="http://readium.org/">Readium</a>, the IDPF's own open-source reference EPUB reading system.</p>

			<p>Unlike Readium, which is a rather heavy solution for EPUB reading, and which attempts to provide a hosted-reading-system-as-library solution for reading eBooks, readk.it approaches the problem from a different angle.</p>


			<h3>What is readk.it?</h3>
			<p>Readk.it is:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>A reading system which is embedded into the EPUB file</li>
				<li>Lightweight and easily-customisable by the publisher to take advantage of browser capabilities</li>
				<li>A reading system which tries to move away from some of the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skeuomorph">skeuomorphisms</a> of current vendor reading systems, instead taking advantage of the possibilities of digital reading.</li>
			</ul>

			<h4>An embeddable reading system</h4>
			<p>Having the reading system travel with the eBook means that publisher's intentions regarding the presentation of their content (as expressed via the configuration of readk.it in a given EPUb file) will always be honoured when a web browser is used to read the eBook.</p>
			<p>At the same time, as the EPUB file is fully compliant with the EPUB3 standard, it is able to be read by any vendor reading system that recognises EPUB3 content (although, of course, possibly with less richness of the content than is available when using readk.it.)</p>
			<p>Although excelling as a reading system that can be customised and embedded in a partiuclar eBook publication, readk.it can also be easily configured as a hosted-reading-system-as-library solution.</p>

			<h4>An easily-customisable reading system</h4>
			<p>As readk.it is built using open web technologies (HTML, CSS and JavaScript), it is easy for a web developer to alter the behaviour of readk.it as they desire. THis may include:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Changing the readk.it chrome, such that some features are disabled, or other features added.</li>
				<li>Customise the branding and user interface of readk.it to reflect their preferences.</li>
				<li>Customise readk.it to support special features of the content.</li>
			</ul>

			<h4>A reading system for digital reading</h4>
			<p>Readk.it avoids some of the more obvious ways that features necessary in printed books have been re-implemented in vendor reading systems, but without adding obvious value. Like the landau roofs used on early motorcars, many of these features, such as page-turn and faux wooden bookshelves tend towards the decorative rather than functional.</p>

			<p>In contrast to page-based presentation of many current vendor reading systems, by default readk.it presents a chapter as a folio, allowing the reader to read the chapter content by continuously scrolling down the content, but also to access other chapters by scrolling across.</p>

			<p>When the reader swipes back to a chapter they have previously been reading, they are positioned at the same place as they were at previously.</p>

			<h3>What does readk.it allow?</h3>
			<p>Readk.it allows publishers:</p>

			<ul>
				<li>to have more control over consistent presentation of their content.</li>
				<li>to easily provide a customised reading experience for a given title.</li>
				<li>to easily tap into advances in web standards and browser technology</li>
				<li>to reach a wider audience using a single content file</li>
			</ul>

			<h4>Consistent presentation of content</h4>
			<p>Although their exist different makes of web browsers, browser manufacturers (including Microsoft with Internet Explorer 10) are doing a good job of standardising on the implementation of web technologies, such that consistent presentation of content is typically easier to acheive than it is with vendor reading systems.</p>

			<p>Using technologies such as CSS media queries, it is possible to produce a single EPUB file of content which will work well across a range of different device sizes, from smartphones to desktop displays.</p>

			<h4>A customised reading experience</h4>
			<p>As readk.it travels with the EPUB file, the reading experience can be customised as necessary for each title.</p>
			<p>Through the use of media queries, different features can be presented for a given screen size, such that, for instance, content is presented more simply on a smartphone screen than on a tablet or desktop display. </p>

			<h4>Tap into advances in browser technology</h4>
			<p>As readk.it is browser-based, as web browsers keep adopting newer features, these are immediately available for use by the content publisher.</p>

			<p>Contrast this with the many vendor reading systems that provide only slow and fitful uptake of technology advances.</p>

			<h3>How does readk.it work?</h3>
			<p>Readk.it is implemented using HTML, CSS and JavaScript, the same technologies that are used with the eBook content.</p>

			<p>Readk.it espouses Responsive Web Design techniques, which allow for suitable reading across a wide range of device sizes.</p>

			<p>As readk.it functions as an integral part of the eBook and travels inside it, the EPUB file can be read conventionally on vendor reading systems (in which case, readk.it is effectively ignored).</p>

			<p>Readk.it can be used to read the eBook content in a number of ways:</p>

			<ul>
				<li>The EPUB can be served up to the reader by a web server, for example in the form of a subscription service</li>
				<li>A web service can be provided which the reader can use to upload the EPUB file, and have it returned to them as web content that can be stored in local storage on their device; in this way, once they've initiated the title via the web service, they can then read the title on their device while offline.</li>
				<li>The EPUB can be delivered as a web-based application in Firefox OS</li>
				<li>A browser extenson can be used to unpack and load the EPUB file into the web browser</li>
			</ul>
