			<h3>What&#8217;s wrong with eBooks?</h3>
			<p>
				Well, where to start? Ebooks are a great medium for both publishers and readers, allowing texts to be viewed across a wide range of different screen sizes, and allowing publishers to sell discrete bundles of content to a willing market.
			</p>
			<p>
				However, although numerous channels exist through which publishers can sell their eBook content, the capabilities of today&#8217;s eBook reading systems are still below par, forcing publishers to compromise on quality and market reach.
			</p>
			
			<p>
				Specific problems that publishers and readers face include:
			</p>

			<ul class="disc">
				<li>Reading systems that aren&#8217;t able to keep up with developments in displaying rich and engaging digital content</li>
				<li>Reading systems that lock both publishers and readers to a particular vendor, reducing market reach</li>
				<li>An eBook standard (EPUB3) that is full of complexity, and difficult to implement commonly across different reading systems</li>
			</ul>

			<h4>The pace of change</h4>
			<p>
				Modern eBook publishing is built on web standards, and these standards are continually evolving. The current versions of the lynchpins of web standards (HTML5 and CSS3) are still not complete, and even when they are they will represent only particular milestones on a constantly evolving road.
			</p>
			<p>
				The amount of investment and effort required to keep reading systems current with the ongoing development of web standards is beyond the means of many vendors, with the result being reading systems that only allow a fraction of the functionality available.
			</p>
			
			<p>
				However, one area where continual improvement in adherence to these evolving web standards is taking place is in the browser arena. Web browser development is backed by large communities of effort, whether this is privately funded or openly sourced. With recent developments such as <a href="http://www.webrtc.org/">WebRTC</a>, the possibilities for technologies such as real-time communication, speech recognition, and gesture-based interaction are opening up.
			</p>

			<p>
				Better than any vendor-specific reading system, modern web browsers offer a solution for viewing and interacting with content, and one that quickly adopts improvements and innovations in web standards. 
			</p>

			<h4>Market reach</h4>
			<p>
				Publishers want to make their content available to a wide readership, while readers want easy access to a wide range of this content. Given that these motives are aligned, it&#8217;s disappointing that many of the available reading systems effectively lock publishers and readers into a single channel. Publishers can develop alternate versions of their content for other channels, and readers can use multiple reading systems to access content provided through different channels, however both would rather have a single version of content that works across the widest range of devices.
			</p>

			<p>
				With most computing devices these days from smartphones and tablets through to desktop computers featuring a web browser, there does exist something resembling a single platform accessible by the largest part of the market. The range of web browsers that are commonly in use (Firefox, Chrome, Safari, Internet Explorer 10, and Opera) is sufficiently narrow for content developers to be able to produce a single version that will work well across all of these, and which will therefore be viewable by readers across a wide range of devices and screen sizes.
			</p>

			<h4>EPUB3: a complex standard</h4>

			<p>
				The EPUB3 standard provides a rich specification for packaging eBook content, but also one that is perhaps too complex in many areas. As we mentioned above, vendors are finding it hard to offer full support for web standards, and the functionality allowed by EPUB3 is proving similarly challenging for reading system vendors. In particular, vendors are finding it difficult to be able to fully and commonly implement EPUB3 in their reading systems, such that complex content will work and appear seamlessly and similarly across different reading systems.
			</p>

			<p>
				Given that EPUB3 is based on HTML5 and CSS3 and allows the use of scripting technologies, we can turn to the modern web browser as a solution for rendering the content included in an EPUB3 eBook. The missing piece of the puzzle however, is a means of providing structured access and navigation to this content; although it is easy to uncompress an EPUB3 file and open the constituent pages in a web browser, the browser does not inherently know about the navigation and content structure employed by the EPUB3 content.
			</p>

			<h3>The solution</h3>

			<p>
				Using modern web design techniques, coupled with a basic browser-based reading framework allowing structured navigation, we can produce eBooks that provide a book-like experience in the web-browser, but which also fallback to working conventionally in vendor-supplied reading systems. Importantly, browser-based display of the eBook content <strong>provides for a reading experience which is both richer than can be acheived in vendor reading systems, and is also widely available in a consistent fashion.</strong>
			</p>

			<p>
				This solution relies on the following principles:
			</p>

			<ul class="disc">
				<li>The use of modern web design techniques to allow the content to intelligently adapt to the shape of the containing reading system, whether this be a browser on a smartphone, tablet or desktop computer, or whether it is a vendor&#8217;s reading system application.</li>
				<li>Making use of the standards-based support of modern web browsers to provide rich typography, embedded multimedia, and interactivity and animation</li>
				<li>The use of a reading system <strong>embedded inside the eBook</strong>, and which can be used by the browser to display the content <strong>according to the publisher&#8217;s wishes</strong>.</li>
			</ul>

			<h4>Responsive web design</h4>

			<p>Responsive web design involves the use of <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en/docs/CSS/Media_queries">CSS media queries</a> to allow content to behave differently based on the size of the browser screen, as is illustrated <a href="http://mediaqueri.es/">here</a> and <a href="http://responsinator.com/?url=thenextweb.com">here</a>.
			</p>

			<p>With CSS media queries having <a href="http://caniuse.com/css-mediaqueries">across-the-board support</a> from all major browsers, as well as from many vendor reading systems, it is possible to design one version of eBook content that will adapt gracefully to the size of the screen on which it is viewed.
			</p>

			<h4>Rich content</h4>
			<p>
				Web standards have evolved to the point where they support rich typography, native support for video and audio, and animation and interactivity that supports the content. Modern web browsers now provide reasonably consistent implementations of these standards, and the inclusion of these web browsers on many computing devices means that publishers can produce rich content that provides a consistent experience for a wide range of readers.
			</p>

			<h4>A reading system embedded inside the EPUB file</h4>
			<p>
				This is undoubtedly the most novel part of the solution, and I'm sure one which will cause some head-scratching and debate. Given that a reading system embedded inside the EPUB file can be developed using the same technologies as the content (HTML, CSS and JavaScript, as with <a href="http://readium.org/">Readium</a>, the IDPF&#8217;s browser-based &#8212; but not embedded &#8212; reading system), this reading system can then be used by a web browser to allow structured navigation through the content.
			</p>
			
			<p>
				The question then becomes how to serve the eBook content to the web browser.
