			<p>Readk.it offers a simple solution to one of biggest problems of modern eBooks: that of the inadequate and inconsistent presentation functionality offered by the competing vendor reading systems.</p>

			<p>From this problem stem a number of other problems affecting eBook publishers:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Different vendor reading systems means publishers have to maintain different digital versions of a given title.</li>
				<li>Vendor reading systems offer inconsistent and incomplete support for HTML5 and CSS3, the technologies on which EPUB eBooks are built. Much more is possible in terms of rich content presentation using a modern web browser than is available in most vendor reading systems.</li>
				<li>The various differences in the vendor reading systems means that publishers have less control  over and certainty about the presentation of their content; a bug that is currently being worked around in a vendor's reading system may be fixed in a new release, while this new release may introduce other bugs that affect content presentation.</li>
				<li>The multitude of vendor reading systems serving different parts of the reading market means that it is difficult for a publisher to easily offer their titles to the reading public en masse.</li>
			</ul>

			<h3>The problem with dedicated eBook reading systems</h3>
			<p>Given that eBook reading systems have a narrower focus than a web browser, you would think that their task of suitably and faithfully presenting eBook content as per the publisher's wishes would be acheivable.</p>

			<p>However, unfortunately this is not the case.</p>

			<h4>Vendor reading systems and the pace of change</h4>
			<p>Vendor reading systems are finding it hard to keep up with the pace of change; both HTML and CSS are evolving standards, with HTML5 not yet ratified, although EPUB3 is regarded as a complete standard. This leads to difficulties and inconsistencies for reading system vendors as they have to make choices about which features of HTML and CSS to implement without breaking the presentation of eBooks already in the market.</p>

			<p>Although this is also a problem for browser manufacturers, they are able to adapt more quickly as:</p>

			<ul>
				<li>Browser manufacturers typically have more resources (either internally or in the form of wide communities of support) than many reading systems vendors.</li>
				<li>Many browser manufacturers have developed a system of automatic deployment of new versions, such that your computer will continually check-in to determine whether the browser needs updating.</li>
			</ul>

			<h4>EPUB3: a complicated standard</h4>
			<p>Although there is much of good in the EPUB3 standard, it is proving problematic because it is a complex standard based on still-evolving technologies. Added to this is the fact that it also has a certain lattitude for implementation of certain features.</p>

			<p>Much of what publishers actually wish to achieve in terms of presentation of their content can be acheived using the web browser, as proven by <a href="http://readium.org/">Readium</a>, the IDPF's own open-source reference EPUB reading system.</p>

			<p>Unlike Readium, which is a rather heavy solution for EPUB reading, and which attempts to provide a hosted-reading-system-as-library solution for reading eBooks, readk.it approaches the problem from a different angle.</p>
