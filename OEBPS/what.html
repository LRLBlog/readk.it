			<p>Readk.it is:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>A reading system which is embedded into the EPUB file</li>
				<li>Lightweight and easily-customisable by the publisher to take advantage of browser capabilities</li>
				<li>A reading system which tries to move away from some of the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skeuomorph">skeuomorphisms</a> of current vendor reading systems, instead taking advantage of the possibilities of digital reading.</li>
			</ul>

			<h4>An embeddable reading system</h4>
			<p>Having the reading system travel with the eBook means that publisher's intentions regarding the presentation of their content (as expressed via the configuration of readk.it in a given EPUb file) will always be honoured when a web browser is used to read the eBook.</p>
			<p>At the same time, as the EPUB file is fully compliant with the EPUB3 standard, it is able to be read by any vendor reading system that recognises EPUB3 content (although, of course, possibly with less richness of the content than is available when using readk.it.)</p>
			<p>Although excelling as a reading system that can be customised and embedded in a partiuclar eBook publication, readk.it can also be easily configured as a hosted-reading-system-as-library solution.</p>

			<h4>An easily-customisable reading system</h4>
			<p>As readk.it is built using open web technologies (HTML, CSS and JavaScript), it is easy for a web developer to alter the behaviour of readk.it as they desire. THis may include:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Changing the readk.it chrome, such that some features are disabled, or other features added.</li>
				<li>Customise the branding and user interface of readk.it to reflect their preferences.</li>
				<li>Customise readk.it to support special features of the content.</li>
			</ul>

			<h4>A reading system for digital reading</h4>
			<p>Readk.it avoids some of the more obvious ways that features necessary in printed books have been re-implemented in vendor reading systems, but without adding obvious value. Like the landau roofs used on early motorcars, many of these features, such as page-turn and faux wooden bookshelves tend towards the decorative rather than functional.</p>

			<p>In contrast to page-based presentation of many current vendor reading systems, by default readk.it presents a chapter as a folio, allowing the reader to read the chapter content by continuously scrolling down the content, but also to access other chapters by scrolling across.</p>

			<p>When the reader swipes back to a chapter they have previously been reading, they are positioned at the same place as they were at previously.</p>

			<h3>What does readk.it allow?</h3>
			<p>Readk.it allows publishers:</p>

			<ul>
				<li>to have more control over consistent presentation of their content.</li>
				<li>to easily provide a customised reading experience for a given title.</li>
				<li>to easily tap into advances in web standards and browser technology</li>
				<li>to reach a wider audience using a single content file</li>
			</ul>

			<h4>Consistent presentation of content</h4>
			<p>Although their exist different makes of web browsers, browser manufacturers (including Microsoft with Internet Explorer 10) are doing a good job of standardising on the implementation of web technologies, such that consistent presentation of content is typically easier to acheive than it is with vendor reading systems.</p>

			<p>Using technologies such as CSS media queries, it is possible to produce a single EPUB file of content which will work well across a range of different device sizes, from smartphones to desktop displays.</p>

			<h4>A customised reading experience</h4>
			<p>As readk.it travels with the EPUB file, the reading experience can be customised as necessary for each title.</p>
			<p>Through the use of media queries, different features can be presented for a given screen size, such that, for instance, content is presented more simply on a smartphone screen than on a tablet or desktop display. </p>

			<h4>Tap into advances in browser technology</h4>
			<p>As readk.it is browser-based, as web browsers keep adopting newer features, these are immediately available for use by the content publisher.</p>

			<p>Contrast this with the many vendor reading systems that provide only slow and fitful uptake of technology advances.</p>
